The Neoclassical growth model (20 marks) Consider an economy with the following aggregate production function: Y, = AK&EP Ni? where Y, is aggregate output, A represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock, N; is the number of workers in the economy, and E is the quantity of energy. Total factor productivity, A, and energy, E, are fixed (constant). The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at rate d, and the households save a constant fraction s of their income. a) Lety, = \", k= = , and e, = 7 Derive the intensive form of the production function in per C t worker terms. Show your steps. b) Suppose the steady state investment for this economy is: ] = (n + d)K. Find an expression for the capital-labour ratio in the steady state. c) Derive an algebraic expression for the Golden Rule level of capital per worker, kg. For what saving rate (s) will the steady-state level of capital per worker equal the Golden Rule level of capital per worker? d) Now assume there is a massive storm and 25% of the energy grid becomes unusable. In other words, this 25% is no longer available for production. Find the new steady-state capital-labour ratio. Show on a graph and explain the transition between the old and the new equilibrium. B.2 Equilibrium in Labour Market (20 marks) Suppose we have an economy with the following aggregate production function: Y = K*(AN)* + EY Y stands for output, K for the capital stock, N for the number of people employed in production, F for the quantity of energy used in production, and A for a measure of labour efficiency. The coefficients a, 8 and y are parameters whose values are between 0 and 1. Suppose a = 8 = y = 0.5. a) Based on the production function, derive an algebraic expression for the demand for labour, assuming that w is the real wage. Be sure to sub in the values for a and f as this will simplify your final relationship. b) Now suppose that the supply curve is upward-sloping and has the following form: Ni =w i. Find an algebraic equation for the equilibrium real wage, #, and equilibrium employment, NV. ii. Now suppose, A = 4; K = 16; and E= 1. Compute the values for the equilibrium real wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output, Y. Use 2 decimals if needed. c) Suppose there is a negative supply shock and A decreases to 3. Find the new values for the equilibrium real wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output, Y. Use 2 decimals if needed. Also, show this shock using 2 graphs: one for the labour market and another for the production function. d) Instead of the supply shock of part c), let's suppose the country invest heavily in energy infrastructure and the quantity of energy quadruple, E = 4. Find the new values for the equilibrium real wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output, Y. Use 2 decimals if needed. B.3 Closed economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks) The following represents the key equations of a closed economy Cc? =20+0.5(Y -T) -100r Desired consumption 14 = 25-100r Desired investment Y=C4+I7+G Equilibrium M4/P =5+0.5Y - 200(r + 7°) Real money demand In the above, Y is real output, T is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate, 7° is expected inflation and P is the price level. Note that r + 7° is the nominal rate of interest and that the central bank controls the money supply (). As well, note that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations. a) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the AD curve with Y on the left-hand side. Be sure to include inflation expectations (7°). b) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 41; the price level is 1; the level of taxation is 30; the budget is balanced; and expected inflation is 2%, which in turn is the central bank's inflation target. Based on this, find the level of full-employment output and then the real rate of interest. c) Recently, Canada along with other economies has been experiencing inflation problems. Using the model here, suppose that 7° rises to 4%, due to news about impending temporary supply disruptions. Note the FE curve is not affected. Assuming that the central bank keeps the nominal money supply unchanged, calculate what happens to output and the real interest rate in the short run. [Hint: Use the ZS curve to find the new real rate of interest.] d) In the face of the increase in expected inflation, the Bank of Canada decides to keep the money supply unchanged and let the economy adjust back to equilibrium. Rewrite your AD curve with the price level on the left-hand side and then calculate what happens to the price level as the economy moves back to the equilibrium level of output that you found in b). Briefly describe the mechanism driving the economy back to equilibrium. As well, suppose that it takes three years for the economy to adjust back to equilibrium. What is the annual inflation rate? Is the rate above the Bank's target 2% target? B4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks) The economy in question is small and takes the world rate of interest (r\") as given. It can be described by the following equations: C4 =18 + 0.6(Y -T) - 100r\" Desired consumption 14 = 19-100r\" Desired investment NX4 = 10-0.1Y - 3e Desire net exports Y=C4+1974+G+4NX4 Equilibrium M?4/P =7.5 + 0.5Y -200r\" Real money demand € = CnomP/Pror Real exchange rate As above, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations. a) Your first task is to derive expressions for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand sides of your equations. Now use those two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with Y on the left-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side. You will be working with these two equations plus those for net export and real exchange rate above. b) You are given the following information: government spending (G) is 30; the government has a deficit of 5; the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5; and the real money supply (M#/P) is 45. Find first the level of output, which you are to assume is the economy's long-run equilibrium level, as well as the world real rate of interest (r\"). Next assume that the nominal money supply (M4) is 54, use your price level equation to calculate the price level. If the foreign price level (Pro) is 1, what is the level of the nominal exchange rate (€n9.,)? Find as well, the level of net exports. c) Assume that this economy has adopted a fixed exchange rate system and that the nominal exchange rate, €nom, is pegged at the level you found in b). Use your model to find the short-run effect on output of a rise in government spending from 30 to 32. Note that the government deficit also rises as taxes remain constant at the level found in b). Use your model to calculate what has happened to the money supply in the short run and explain why. In the long, the economy must return to equilibrium. Describe what has to happen to net exports in equilibrium given the increase in government spending. Based on this, use the net export equation to find the new level of the real exchange rate and the new level of the domestic price level. d) Now assume that this economy has adopted a flexible exchange rate system; that is, the nominal exchange rate, @nom, will now do the adjusting. Based on the class discussion, use the TS-I.M-FE diagrams to describe what would happen in the short and long run when the government raises spending from 30 to 32. As well, calculate what would happen to the nominal exchange rate to restore equilibrium."

Long Run Economic Growth in the Solow model (20 marks) Consider an economy with the following aggregate production function: ¥, = AKEN}-* where Y, is aggregate output, A, represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock, and N; is the number of workers in the economy. The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at rate d, and the households save a constant fraction, s, of their income. a) Let y, = Ad and k, = = . Derive the intensive form of the production function in per worker terms. t t Show your steps. b) Derive an algebraic expression for the level of investment per worker and saving per worker in a steady-state equilibrium. Also, find the expression for the capital-labour ratio in the steady state. With the aid of the diagram, show that this equilibrium point is stable. Briefly explain your reasoning. c) Now, suppose there are two economies (A and",
        "that are described by the intensive form of the production function found in part a). The two economies are identical in all respects except that A has a higher savings rate than B: s, > Sg. Explain using a diagram what this implies for the relative steadystate levels of capital and output per worker in each country. d) Suppose that, in addition to having a higher savings rate, economy A also has a higher population growth rate than economy B: s, > Sg and ny > ng. Is it possible that both economies have the same steady-state output per worker? Explain with the aid of a diagram. B2. Asset market equilibrium (20 marks) Suppose that the real money demand function is given by ma >= L(Y,r+x°) = 7004+0.1Y - 5000 (r+ 7°) where M?@ is the nominal money balances demanded, P is the price level, Y is total output, r is the real interest rate, and 7° is the expected inflation rate. a) Assuming that the asset market is currently in equilibrium at r = 0.05. Calculate the nominal money supply, MS, if Y = 2000, P = 2 and 1° = 0.05. What is the velocity of money in this economy? What is the value of k in the quantity theory of money? b) Assume that the quantity theory of money holds and that velocity is constant at the level you found in part a). In this same economy, the central bank fixes the nominal money supply (M*) at 500. With output fixed at its full-employment level (Y = 2000) and assuming that prices are flexible, what will be the new price level? What happens to the price level if the nominal money supply rises to 600? c) Now, suppose the central bank follows a money supply rule. In particular, it sets the money supply according to: MS = 1000 + 0.1Y - 4000z. If expected inflation equals actual inflation 7 = 1° = 0.03, Y = 1000, and r = 0,02, calculate the price level in equilibrium using the real money demand function in part a). d) Now, suppose that the new real money demand function is given by: mé y?

Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side. b) Assume the expected inflation rate, 1°, is 5%, the real money supply, M /P, is 500, the price level, P, is 1, government spending, G, is 200, and the government has a budget deficit of 100. Using your results from part a), find the full employment level of output, Y, and the real interest rate, r. c) Now assume there is a temporary negative productivity shock and the new full employment level of output, ¥>, is now 1300. Find the price level, P, as well as the real interest rate, r, in the long run. Show graphically and explain the transition between the old and the new long-run equilibria. d) One of the goals of the Bank of Canada is to keep inflation low and stable. Calculate the new level of nominal money supply, M, required to avoid the change in the price level, P, found in part c). In other words, the Bank of Canada wants to keep the price level at 1 in the long run. B4.

Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side. b) Assume the expected inflation rate, 7°, is 5%, the real money supply, M/P, is 1000, the domestic and foreign price level, P and Py,,, are 1, the nominal exchange rate, €nom, is 2, government spending, G, is 450, and the government budget is balanced. Using your results from part a), find the full employment level of output, Y, and the world interest rate, r\". c) Assume this economy has a flexible exchange rate regime. The central bank has decided to increase the nominal money supply to 1080. Find real output, Ysp, and the real exchange rate, esp, in the Keynesian short-run equilibrium. Also, show graphically and explain the initial equilibrium, the shortrun equilibrium, and the return to the long-run equilibrium. d) \"Consumer sentiment (confidence) falls.\" Using the open economy IS-LM-FE framework, show graphically and explain how the change in consumer expectations, highlighted in this headline, would impact the economy if the economy had: i. A flexible exchange rate regime. ii. A fixed exchange rate regime.

The Neoclassical growth model (20 marks) Consider an economy with the following aggregate production function: ¥, = AKZLP Ne =ea0) Production function where Y; is aggregate output, A represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock, N, is the number of workers in the economy, and L is the quantity of available land. Total factor productivity, A, and tand, L, are fixed (constant). The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at rate d, and the households save a constant fraction s of their income. a) Lety, = st, k= pa , and 1, = os Derive the intensive form of the production function in per t t t worker terms. Show your steps. b) The steady state level of investment for this economy is: = (n + d)K. Find an expression for the capital-labour ratio in the steady state, k**. c) Derive an algebraic expression for the Golden Rule level of capital per worker, kg. Show graphically this special steady state. d) Now assume there is an environmental disaster and 10% of the land becomes unusable for production. Find an equation for the new steady-state capital-labour ratio. Show on a graph and explain the transition between the old and the new equilibrium. B.2 Asset Market (20 marks) Assume the real money demand function is: L(Y, i) = 1000 + 0.5Y - 5000(r + 2°) Real money demand where Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate on non-monetary assets, 1° is expected inflation. a) Assuming that the asset market is in equilibrium at i = 0.05. Find equilibrium levels of the real money supply, the nominal money supply, and the velocity of money if P = 1, and Y ="

(Note: please round your answers to the nearest three decimal places for all parts of this question.) b) Find the real income elasticity of money demand at the equilibrium level of money balances found in part a). Explain what it means. 8 of 10 ¢) The rate of inflation in this economy is defined as the growth rate of the nominal money supply minus an adjustment for the growth rate of real money demand arising from growth in the real output: AM AY : Ta Nyy Inflation Suppose the central bank has a target inflation rate of 2%, real output growth is 8%, and the income elasticity of real money demand equals the value found in part b). What actions could the central bank take to attain this objective? d) Does the quantity theory of money hold in this economy; that is does MV= PY? State your reason by considering the new levels of nominal money supply, real output, and price using the growth rates from part ¢). B.3 Closed economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks) The following represents the key equations of a closed economy C4 = 144 0.75(Y -T) - 80r Desired consumption I* =18-60r Desired investment Y=C4+17+G Equilibrium in the goods market M/P=7+0.5(Y -T) -140(r) Real money supply is equal to demand In the above, Y is real output, 7 is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate and P is the price level. Note that 2° = 0, so that the nominal rate of interest is equal to the real rate and that the central bank controls the nominal money supply (14). As well, note that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations of the aggregate demand curve. a) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the AD curve, also with Y on the left-hand side. Note that, different for the classroom version, the demand for money is related to affer-tax income. Looking at the JS and LM curves, discuss (no calculations required) what would happen to each curve if the level of taxation were to fall? Briefly explain why. b) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 40; the price level is 1, the level of taxation is 20; and the government has a budgetary surplus of 5. Based on this, find the level of full-employment output (Y) and then the real rate of interest (7). 9 of 10 c) With an election pending, the government is coming under pressure to do something about its surplus. One group wants the level of taxation to be reduced to the level of government spending, while the other wants government spending to be raised to match current levels of taxation. Based on your aggregate demand curve, calculate the short-run effect of each policy on GDP and the real rate of interest. What happens to interest rates in each case and why? You are to assume that the nominal money supply stays constant at 40. d) As prime minister, you have to make a decision. Using your answers from part ¢, suppose that a significant proportion of the population is young and they are worried about overall demand conditions, in other works, employment prospects. On the other hand, there is an older group that wants less government spending, with minimal effects on interest rates. Both groups are happy to have a balanced budget in place. Based on your model, which alternative appeals to each group. B.4 The open economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks) The following represents the key equations of an open economy: c4 =2+0.80Y - 80r\" Desired consumption 14 = 13-60r\" Desired investment NX4 =12-0.1Y -2e Desired net exports Y=C4+1*+G6+4NX4 Equilibrium in the goods market M/P=12+0.5Y -140r\" Real money supply is equal to demand € = €nomP /Pror Real exchange rate As in Question B.3, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that on money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations. For simplicity, taxation is zero - one less thing to worry about. a) Use the above model to find equations for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand side in each case. Now use these two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with Y on the left-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side. b) You are given the following values for key variables: government spending (G) is 10; the real money supply (//P) is 50; and the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5. Find the level of output, the world real rate of interest (r\") and the trade balance (NX). Assuming that the level of output you found is the economy's equilibrium level and given that M = 50, find the equilibrium price level. Finally suppose that the price level in the foreign country (Pror) is 0.6; what is the level of the nominal exchange rate (€nom)? 10 of 10 c) Assume that the exchange rate is flexible and that the central bank, worried about the high level of prices compared with the foreign country, decides to lower the level of the money supply (M) from 50 to 48. Find the short-run effect on the level of output (Y), the real and nominal exchange rate (e and énom) and net exports (NX) and then the long-run effect of this policy on these variables. [Hint: To find the short-run effect on output, use the LM curve and then proceed to the JS curve to find the short-run level of the real exchange rate, e. To find the long-run effect on the domestic price level use the definition of the real exchange rate.] d) Suppose that the government decides to fix the exchange rate at the nominal value that you found in part b). Note that this assumption implies that the initial real exchange rate is as above, 1.5. The government still wishes to have a lower price level for competitive reasons but, with fixed exchange rates, they cannot use monetary policy. Based on advice from this class, they decide instead to cut government spending from 10 to 9. Use the IS curve that you found in part b) to find the short-run level of output, remembering that e is unchanged. From class, you know that the economy will return to its long-run equilibrium level of output but with a lower level of G and with implications for net exports. Use the net export equation to find the new level of the real exchange rate. Note you will need to find the new level of the trade balance. Finally, based on the definition of the real exchange rate, find the new price level. Comparing the two systems (fixed and flexible exchange rates), which saw the largest fall in the price level?",

With this production function, the marginal product of labour is MPN =2A-0.01AN. Suppose that A = 4. The labour supply curve is NS =55+10(1 -1)u, where NS is the amount of labour supplied, w is the real wage, and ¢ is the tax rate, which is 0.5. Desired consumption and investment are Ct = 2004+ 0.8(Y -T) - 150r; I? = 200 -200r. Taxes and government purchases are T = 10+40.25Y; G = 50. Money demand is Mé4 - = 0A4AY - 200(r + 7°) P The expected rate of inflation 7° is 0.01, and the nominal money supply M is 1000. a. Find an equation that describes the IS curve in the following format: r = f{Y). b. Find an equation that describes the LM curve in the following format: c. Using the IS curve and the LM curve find an equation that describes the aggregate demand (A",
        "curve in the following format: P = h({Y) d. What is the value of output at the FE line? e. Calculate the real interest rate, the investment level, the consumption level and the price level at the general equilibrium point. Graph the general equilibrium. 8 of 4 f. Suppose there is a decrease in G. Explain what will happen to the economy (short-run and long-run) as well as to the aggregate demand curve (short-run only). Use graphs to support your explanation. g. Suppose the central bank can perfectly predict the consequences of the shock described in part f and can react immediately when it occurs. What should it do to achieve its objective of price stability? 9 of 13 Section C LONG QUESTIONS : Answer any TWO (2) of the following three questions. Each question is worth 20 marks. C1. Consider the following version of the neoclassical (Solow) growth model. Suppose the relationship between output and productive inputs at any point in time is represented by Y=A Ke. NOS Suppose also that population growth is n, the savings rate is s, and the rate of depreciation of capital is d. a. Express the production in per worker terms by letting y = x and k= x. b. Derive the dynamics of capital per worker. Derive an expression for the steady-state capital stock per worker, k*, and an expression for the steady-state output per worker, y*. Illustrate the steady-state for this economy on a diagram. c. Now suppose there are two countries (A and",
        "that are identical in all respects except that country A has a higher savings rate than B: s4 > sg. Explain using a diagram what this implies for the relative steady-state levels of capital per worker in each country. One shortcoming of the neoclassical growth model is that the model assumes rather than explains the productivity growth and hence the growth rate of output. In response to this shortcoming, endogenous growth theory has been developed to explain productivity growth. Now suppose we augment the neoclassical model with human capital and output is given by Y = AK®*(RN)°5. Suppose also that population growth is n, the savings rate is s, and the rate of depreciation of capital is d. d. Express the production in per worker terms. Derive the dynamics of capital per worker and an expression for the steady-state capital stock per worker, k*, as a function of human capital per worker h. e. Consider now the two countrie (A and",
        "have the same production function augumented with human capital and equal values of A, s, n and d. Besides in both countries physical capital per worker is proportional to human capital per worker, k = Bh. If country A has twice the human capital h, of country B ha, what does this imply for their relative per worker outputs in steady-state? 10 of 13 C2. Suppose a country that uses a fixed exchange rate system asks your advice and your knowledge on the use of a fixed exchange rate system. Denote their official rate as Eno, and the fundamental value of the nominal exchange rate e*,,,,. a. Suppose the output of that country decreases. How is that affecting the currency market? Use a graph to support your explanation. Assume that the official rate is higher than the fundamental value of nominal exchange rate. b. Suppose there is an increase in the quality of goods produced in a foreign country. How is this improvement affecting the domestic currency market? Use a graph to support your explanation. Assume that the official rate is higher than the fundamental value of nominal exchange rate. c. Suppose there is a decrease in money supply. How is the decrease affecting the economy based on the IS-LM-FE model? Use graphs to support your explanation. What can you conclude about the use of monetary policy as a way to stabilize the economy in this context? Assume that the domestic interest rate is initially equal to the foreign interest rate. d. Suppose the government decides to decrease its spending. How is this fall affecting the economy based on the IS-LM-FE model? Use graphs to support your explanation. What can you conclude on the use of fiscal policy as a way to adjust macroeconomic variables? Assume that the domestic interest rate is initially equal to the foreign interest rate. 11 of 1% C3. Suppose a Canadian resident wants to purchase a $100,000 asset. This citizen is interested in investing in either the government, bond from the United States of America or the government bond from France. Both investments last two years. Before making the investment, the Canadian investor collected the information for several countries: Country Amount of currency Annual interest rate U.S.A 110 3% France 100 2% Japan 12,000 5% Canada 147 4% ' a. Given that the investor is interested in only two bonds and given its following expected nominal exchange rates: Country Expected nominal exchange rate in two years U.S.A 0.719 France 0.625 Japan 93.75 Canada 1.00 Calculate the expected gross nominal rate of return for both bonds. Which one will the investor choose? b. Assume that the interest rate parity holds between the two bonds. Which bond would the investor prefer? c. Suppose that the cost of a coffee in France is 1 euro and that the same coffee costs $1.50 in Canada. Calculate the real exchange rate. What can you say about its value? d. Assume that the purchasing power parity hypothesis holds. What would be the real exchange rate? e. Suppose that instead of dealing with levels, someone is interested in percentage change. Write down the equation (without assuming the PPP hypothesis and without values). What is the relative purchasing power parity hypothesis? How different is the equation if the hypothesis holds? : f. Show why the relative purchasing power parity hypothesis is a weaker implication than the purchasing power parity hypothesis. Multiple Choice Instructions.

Consider the following augmented version of the Solow (neoclassical) growth model. Suppose that the relationship between output per worker, y, physical capital per worker, k, and human capital per worker, h, at any point in time is represented by y = Af(k,h). The function f is increasing in k and h, and has diminishing marginal product of k. Suppose that A and h are exogenous constants, population growth is n > 0, the savings rate is s, and the rate of depreciation of capital is d > 0. (1) Explain intuitively why the dynamic evolution of k is described by the equation Ak = sAf(k,h) -(n+4)k. (2) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, is determined. If the initial value of k is ko < k*, illustrate and explain the process by which the economy converges to the steady state. (3) IWustrate on a diagram the impact of an increase in the stock of human capital per worker, h, on the steady-state level of output per worker. Describe how the economy adjusts from its original steady state to the new steady state. (4) Consider two countries that have the same production function y= Akh? and equal values of A = 1, s = 0.2, n = 0.02 and d = 0.08. If country 2 has twice the human capital per worker of country 1, analyze what this implies for the two countries' relative per worker outputs in steady state. (5) Explain the idea of conditional convergence that is predicted by the Solow model. Explain why this prediction need not be inconsistent with the overall pattern of divergence in the distribution of relative per capita income observed in the real world. Problem 3. (26 points): Closed economy IS-LM-FE. The following four equations describe a closed economy: C4+=19+0.5(Y -T) -100r Desired consumption I¢=27-50r Desired investment Y=Ct?+I4+G Goods market equilibrium M=94+06Y -150r Money market equilibrium ~e In the above, Y is real output, T is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real rate of interest, and P is the aggregate price level. Note that in the final equation, M is the money supply (which is under the control of the central bank) and it is set equal to the demand for money. You should also note that the interest-rate coefficients on consumption and investment sum to 150, which is equal to the interest-rate coefficient on the money demand equation. This will make deriving the AD curve somewhat less burdensome. (1) Find the IS and LM curves for the economy, in each case with the real interest rate on the left-hand side. Derive as well an equation for the aggregate demand, AD, curve, with Y on the left-hand side. (2) Suppose that G = 20, M/P = 60 and that the government is running a budgetary surplus of 5. Given this information, find the level of real output, Y , using the AD curve for this economy. Given the level of real output (Y) that you found, use the equation for your LM curve to solve for the real rate of interest, r. You are to assume that the values of Y and r that you found are the long-run equilibrium values for this economy. As well, assume that the price level is 1, implying that the nominal money supply is 60. (3) Because of innovations in the financial system, the public is able to economize on its holdings for money balances. In your model, this is reflected as a shift down in the demand for real money balances and is captured by having the constant term in the money demand equation decline from 9 to 7. Initially the central bank holds the money supply constant at 60. Use again your AD curve to find the new level of output. [Hint: In this short-run equilibrium, hold the price level, P, constant.] (4) Using the diagrams familiar to you from class and the course, describe what is happening. Be sure to compare the new level of output you found with that you found in part (2). Based on this comparison, what are the implications for the price level. (5) Now rewrite your AD curve, with the price level, P, on the left-hand side. Suppose that the economy is now back in equilibrium, with Y = Y , where Y is equal to the level you found in part (2). What has happened to the price level? What process is being illustrated? (6) Suppose now that the central bank is worried about the inflationary implications of the shift in the money demand equation. What would be the implications for the money supply supposing that the central bank wanted to keep the price level unchanged at the level in part (2)? Problem 4. (26 points): Open economy IS-LM-FE. Keeping the equations for C4, J¢, and u the same as in Problem 3 above, suppose that this economy becomes open to trade. To capture this development, an equation for net exports, NX*%, has been added. The final equation is the definition of the real exchange rate, e. Note that the country is small and takes the world real rate of interest, r\" , as given. C4=19+0.5(Y -T) -100r\" Desired consumption I¢=27-50r\" Desired investment Y=Ct+I4+G+NxX? Goods market equilibrium NX?¢ =21.5--0.1Y -4e Desired net exports uy =9+0.6Y - 150r\" Money market equilibrium e= Sem Real exchange rate (1) Use the above equations to write out the IS and LM curves for this economy, with r\" on the left-hand side. (2) Suppose that the world interest rate is 4% and that the real money supply is 66. Find the level of real output, Y. (3) The economy is specialized in certain goods and services and, as a result, it has a surplus of 5; that is, NX¢ = 5. Find the level of the real exchange rate, e. If the price level (P) in this economy were equal to the foreign price level (Py,,), what would be the level of the nominal exchange rate, €nom? (4) Assume that the nominal exchange rate is fixed at the level you found in part (3). As well assume that G = 20 and T = 25. Now suppose that the economy is hit with a 25% tariff, which in effect will raise the domestic price level, P, by that amount. What is the new level of the real exchange rate? (5) Now find the new, short-run level of output, assuming that the nominal exchange rate is unchanged. To do this, you will have to use your IS curve, but now with output, Y, on the right-hand side. In percentage terms, by how much has output changed? (6) Use the diagrams for the IS, LM and FE model to describe what would happen in the long run to output, the domestic price level and the nominal and real exchange rate assuming in turn that the economy has fixed and then flexible exchange rates. Note that no math is required for this part."

In other words, consumers and business owners are not optimistic about the future of the economy. The change in behaviour from consumers and business owners is represented by a change in the constants of the desired consumption and desired investment equations.

Using a graph of the IS-LM-FE framework, show and explain the transition from the initial equilibrium (part b)) to the short-run equilibrium, and the retum to the long-run equilibrium. Make sure to label your axes and curves and indicate clearly the shift of the curves. /Note: The constants of the two equations are added together when the IS curve is built. Therefore it does not matter how the 18 is added or subtracted from the desired consumption and desired investment equations. ] d) The authorities are aware of this lack of optimism in the economy, via the Consumer Confidence Survey and the Business Outlook Survey, and fear it will lead to a recession. They decide to act to keep output at its full employment level, Y. i. The government could use its fiscal policy (G and T). Calculate the change required in G and in T (two different cases). . ii. Instead, the central bank could use its monetary policy (M). Calculate the required change in M. B4.

Solow (neoclassical) growth model: Consider the Solow (neoclassical) growth model seen in class where y denotes output per worker, & physical capital per worker, and A total factor productivity. Suppose that at any point in time the production function in per-worker terms is represented by : y = Ak?, where f(k) is increasing in k and there are diminishing returns to capital. Suppose that A is constant, labour N grows at rate n, the saving rate is s, and the rate of capital depreciation is d. (a) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, is determined. (b) Solve for the steady-state level of capital per worker k*, output per worker, y*, and consumption per worker, c*, assuming that total factor productivity, A, is 1, the saving rate, 8, is 0.4, the population growth, n, is 0.02, and the depreciation rate, d, is 0.08. (c) Suppose that there is a war that destroys half the capital stock, K, but leaves the labour force unchanged. Calculate the immediate impact of the war on capital per worker, output per worker, and consumption per worker. (d) Show graphically how the economy returns to the steady-state following the destruction of half the capital stock. (e) Suppose instead that the war destroys half the labour force (NV) but leaves the capital stock unchanged. Assume that the economy was in the steady-state derived in part (b) before the war and the rate of population growth, n, returns to normal after the war. Calculate the immediate impact of the war on capital per worker, output per worker, and consumption per worker. B2. Closed Economy IS-LM-FE model: The behaviour of households and firms in a closed economy is represented by the following equations: Desired consumption : OC? = 200 +0.8(Y -T) - 500r Desired investment. : I¢ = 200 - 500r Mé Real money demand : >= 0.5Y - 250(r + 1) where expected inflation is 7* = 0.10 and taxes depend on income according to T = 20 + 0.25Y. Government purchases are represented by G. (a) Derive an expression for the IS curve with the real interest rate on the left side of the equation. How does the position of the IS curve depend on G? (b) If the money supply is M = 9890 derive an expression for the LM curve, with the real interest rate on the left side of the equation. How does the position of the LM curve depend on P? (c) If government purchases are G = 196, derive an expression for the aggregate demand curve. If the full-employment output level is Y = 1000, what is the price level and the real interest rate in general equilibrium? (d) Starting from the situation in part (c), suppose government purchases are increased to G = 216, what are the resulting values of Y, r, P, T, C* and I? in the short-run? (e) How does the economy adjust to its new general equilibrium after the change in part (d)? What are the resulting general equilibrium values of Y, r, P, T, C4? and I4? B3. Open Economy IS-LM-FE model: The behaviour of households and firms in an open economy is represented by the following equations: Full-employment output : Y = 1200 Desired consumption : C* = 350 + 0.5Y - 200r Desired investment : I? = 250 - 300r Government purchases. : G=95 Net exports : NX = 100 -0.1Y -0.5e Real exchange rate : e¢=90. Assume that the real interest rate, r, does not deviate from the foreign interest rate and that the economy is initially in general equilibrium. (a) Derive the open-economy I'S curve writing the real interest rate on the left side of the equation. (b) The LM curve for this economy is described by Y-M/P r= --- where P denotes the price level and M denotes the nominal money supply. Assume M = 480. What are the general equilibrium values of r and P? Illustrate this general equilibrium using the IS-LM-FE diagram. (c) Suppose that this economy has a flexible nominal exchange rate and that the government decides to impose an import quota in order to restrict imports. What would be the short-run effect of this policy on Y, NX, and e holding the price level P constant (no calculations ' necessary)? Illustrate the effects using the IS-LM-FE diagram. (d) Suppose instead that this economy has a fixed exchange rate. What would be the shortrun effect of this policy on Y, NX, and e holding the price level P constant (no calculations necessary)? Illustrate the effects using the IS-LM-FE diagram. (e) Explain the process that restores the economy to general equilibrium under fixed exchange rates. How do the Keynesian and classical views differ on this process? B4. Closed economy Keynesian model: The aggregate demand-side of the economy of Rigidia is well-described by a standard IS-LM-FE framework while the short-run aggregate supply side is characterized by 7 Y=Y+0(P - P*). (SRAS) Here Y is realized aggregate output/income, ¥ is the full employment output level, P is the aggregate realized price level, P* is the expected price level and 6 is a constant that depends on the slope of the labour demand curve. Explain the effects of each of the following on the values of Y, the real interest rate, r, P and P*, both in the short-run and as the economy adjusts towards general equilibrium. Assume that all changes are unanticipated. In each case, illustrate the effects using ISLM-FE and AD-AS diagrams, starting from an initial situation of general equilibrium and explain in words. (a) A reduction in the effective tax rate on capital that increases desired investment. (b) A rise in the expected rate of inflation. (c) An influx of working-age immigrants which increases the labour supply. (d) An increase in the volatility of the stock market. (e) An decrease in government purchases. il"

Solow (neoclassical) growth model: Consider the Solow (neoclassical) growth model seen in class where y denotes output per worker, k physical capital per worker, and A total factor productivity. Suppose that at any point in time the production function in per-worker terms is represented by y = Af(k), where f(k) is increasing in & and there are diminishing returns to capital. Suppose that A is constant, labour N grows at rate n, the saving rate is s, and the rate of capital depreciation is d. (a) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, is determined. (b) Suppose that there is a shock to households' preferences that increases the saving rate to sg, the saving rate consistent with moving the economy to the Golden Rule steady state. Show graphically how the economy reaches the new steady state. Explain what happens to steady-state consumption per-worker, c*, and to the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, after the rise in s. (c) At what rate do output per worker, y, and output, Y, grow at the new steady state? What about during the period of adjustment from the original steady steady to the new one? (d) Suppose that before the shock to households' preferences, the saving rate was above sg. What happens in this case to steady-state consumption per-worker, c*, and the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, after the rise in s. (e) According to the Solow (neoclassical) growth model, what is the dominant factor determining the long-run growth of output per capita? Explain why. B2. Closed Economy IS-LM-FE: The behaviour of households and firms in a closed economy is represented by the following equations: Y = 2(25N -0.25N?) NS = 0.25w Cc? = 40+0.8Y I? = 80-500r Mé > 0.5Y - 250(r + 7°) where 7° = 0.02 where Y is output, N is labour, w is the real wage, N* is the amount of labour supplied, C* is desired consumption, I? is desired investment, Me is the real money demand, r is the real interest rate, and 7° is the expected inflation. Assume that the economy is initially in a general equilibrium with government expenditure G set to 20, the nominal money supply M set to 195 and the price level P equal to 1. (a) What are the gencral equilibrium levels of the real wage, employment, and output? (b) Derive the IS and LM equations writing the real interest rate on the left side of the equations. Find the implied long-run real interest rate and output. (c) Suppose the government increases its expenditure to G = 40. What are the short-run output and real interest rate? INustrate the transition from the general equilibrium to the short-run equilibrium using the IS-LM-FE diagram. (d) Compute the crowding out effect in adjusting from the general equilibrium to the shortrun equilibrium after the fiscal expansion. (e) Explain the process that restores the economy to general equilibrium according to the Keynesian and classical view (no calculations necessary). B3. Use the open-economy IS-LM-FE model with flexible exchange rates to explain the effects of each of the following on the values of output, Y, the real interest rate, r, the nominal exchange rate, €nom, the price level, P, the real exchange rate, € = (€nom X P)/Pror, and net exports, NX, in the short-run and in general equilibrium. In each case, illustrate the effects on a diagram starting from an initial situation of general equilibrium. (a) A reduction in the effective tax rate on capital that increases desired investment. (b) A rise in the expected rate of inflation. (c) An influx of working-age immigrants which increases the labour supply. (d) An increase in the volatility of the stock market. (e) A decrease in the world real interest rate. B4. Keynesian model with nominal wage rigidity: Consider a simple economy in which all workers are identical and only one type of good is produced. The production function is 1 Y =4N2, where Y is output and N is the number of workers (in millions). The supply curve for labour is given by Ww N* =05 > P where W is the nominal wage and P is the aggregate price level (so W/P is the real wage). (a) Derive the labour demand curve. (b) If the labour market is in equilibrium, find the implied real wage, the level of ermployment, and full-employment output, Y. (c) Suppose W is determined before P is known for sure at a value such that the labour market is expected to clear. If the expected price level is P* = 2, at what value is W set? For any realized price level, P, what is employment and what is the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve for this economy? The IS and LM curves for this economy are described by 4000r = 800- 100Y (IS) M 2000r = 50Y - 6S (LM) where Y denotes income/output, r denotes the real interest rate and M = 100 is the money supply. (d) Derive the equation for the aggregate demand (A",

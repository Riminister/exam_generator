500,"500. (Note: please round your answers to the nearest three decimal places for all parts of this question.) b) Find the real income elasticity of money demand at the equilibrium level of money balances found in part a). Explain what it means. 8 of 10 ¢) The rate of inflation in this economy is defined as the growth rate of the nominal money supply minus an adjustment for the growth rate of real money demand arising from growth in the real output: AM AY : Ta Nyy Inflation Suppose the central bank has a target inflation rate of 2%, real output growth is 8%, and the income elasticity of real money demand equals the value found in part b). What actions could the central bank take to attain this objective? d) Does the quantity theory of money hold in this economy; that is does MV= PY? State your reason by considering the new levels of nominal money supply, real output, and price using the growth rates from part ¢). B.3 Closed economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks) The following represents the key equations of a closed economy C4 = 144 0.75(Y -T) - 80r Desired consumption I* =18-60r Desired investment Y=C4+17+G Equilibrium in the goods market M/P=7+0.5(Y -T) -140(r) Real money supply is equal to demand In the above, Y is real output, 7 is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate and P is the price level. Note that 2° = 0, so that the nominal rate of interest is equal to the real rate and that the central bank controls the nominal money supply (14). As well, note that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations of the aggregate demand curve. a) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the AD curve, also with Y on the left-hand side. Note that, different for the classroom version, the demand for money is related to affer-tax income. Looking at the JS and LM curves, discuss (no calculations required) what would happen to each curve if the level of taxation were to fall? Briefly explain why. b) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 40; the price level is 1, the level of taxation is 20; and the government has a budgetary surplus of 5. Based on this, find the level of full-employment output (Y) and then the real rate of interest (7). 9 of 10 c) With an election pending, the government is coming under pressure to do something about its surplus. One group wants the level of taxation to be reduced to the level of government spending, while the other wants government spending to be raised to match current levels of taxation. Based on your aggregate demand curve, calculate the short-run effect of each policy on GDP and the real rate of interest. What happens to interest rates in each case and why? You are to assume that the nominal money supply stays constant at 40. d) As prime minister, you have to make a decision. Using your answers from part ¢, suppose that a significant proportion of the population is young and they are worried about overall demand conditions, in other works, employment prospects. On the other hand, there is an older group that wants less government spending, with minimal effects on interest rates. Both groups are happy to have a balanced budget in place. Based on your model, which alternative appeals to each group. B.4 The open economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks) The following represents the key equations of an open economy: c4 =2+0.80Y - 80r"" Desired consumption 14 = 13-60r"" Desired investment NX4 =12-0.1Y -2e Desired net exports Y=C4+1*+G6+4NX4 Equilibrium in the goods market M/P=12+0.5Y -140r"" Real money supply is equal to demand € = €nomP /Pror Real exchange rate As in Question B.3, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that on money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations. For simplicity, taxation is zero - one less thing to worry about. a) Use the above model to find equations for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand side in each case. Now use these two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with Y on the left-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side. b) You are given the following values for key variables: government spending (G) is 10; the real money supply (//P) is 50; and the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5. Find the level of output, the world real rate of interest (r"") and the trade balance (NX). Assuming that the level of output you found is the economy's equilibrium level and given that M = 50, find the equilibrium price level. Finally suppose that the price level in the foreign country (Pror) is 0.6; what is the level of the nominal exchange rate (€nom)? 10 of 10 c) Assume that the exchange rate is flexible and that the central bank, worried about the high level of prices compared with the foreign country, decides to lower the level of the money supply (M) from 50 to 48. Find the short-run effect on the level of output (Y), the real and nominal exchange rate (e and énom) and net exports (NX) and then the long-run effect of this policy on these variables. [Hint: To find the short-run effect on output, use the LM curve and then proceed to the JS curve to find the short-run level of the real exchange rate, e. To find the long-run effect on the domestic price level use the definition of the real exchange rate.] d) Suppose that the government decides to fix the exchange rate at the nominal value that you found in part b). Note that this assumption implies that the initial real exchange rate is as above, 1.5. The government still wishes to have a lower price level for competitive reasons but, with fixed exchange rates, they cannot use monetary policy. Based on advice from this class, they decide instead to cut government spending from 10 to 9. Use the IS curve that you found in part b) to find the short-run level of output, remembering that e is unchanged. From class, you know that the economy will return to its long-run equilibrium level of output but with a lower level of G and with implications for net exports. Use the net export equation to find the new level of the real exchange rate. Note you will need to find the new level of the trade balance. Finally, based on the definition of the real exchange rate, find the new price level.

(Note: please round your answers to the nearest three decimal places for all parts of this question.) b) Find the real income elasticity of money demand at the equilibrium level of money balances found in part a). c) The rate of inflation in this economy is defined as the growth rate of the nominal money supply minus an adjustment for the growth rate of real money demand arising from growth in the real output: _ AM AY ""uM UY Assume that real income is expected to grow by 5% over the next year, the interest rate remains constant, and the income elasticity of real money demand equals the value found in part b). Find out how much the central bank should increase the nominal money supply if it pursues an inflation target of zero inflation for the next year. Also, find the new level of nominal money supply in this economy. d) Does the quantity theory of money hold in this economy? State your reason by considering the new level of nominal money supply in part c) and given that P = 100, and Y = 2000. B3. The closed economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks) A closed economy is described by the following equations: C4 = 100 + 0.5(Y¥ - T) - 500r I4 = 300 - 400r ma >= 10 + 0.5Y - 900(r + 7°) where Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate, 7°, is inflation expectations, T is a lump-sum tax, C4, is desired consumption, /? is desired investment, and M is the nominal supply of money which is set by the central bank. a) Derive an algebraic expression for the IS and LM curves with the real interest rate, 7, on the left-hand side of the equation. Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side. b) Assume the expected inflation rate, 1°, is 2%, the real money supply, M/P, is 100, the price level, P, is 1, government spending, G, is 100, and the government budget is balanced. Using your results from part a), find the full employment level of output, Y, and the real interest rate, r. c) Now, suppose consumers and business owners' confidence weakened. In other words, consumers and business owners are not optimistic about the future of the economy. The change in behaviour from consumers and business owners is represented by a change in the constants of the desired consumption and desired investment equations. Altogether, the constants change by 18. Find real output, Ysp, and the real interest real, rsp, in the Keynesian short-run equilibrium. Using a graph of the IS-LM-FE framework, show and explain the transition from the initial equilibrium (part b)) to the short-run equilibrium, and the retum to the long-run equilibrium. Make sure to label your axes and curves and indicate clearly the shift of the curves. /Note: The constants of the two equations are added together when the IS curve is built. Therefore it does not matter how the 18 is added or subtracted from the desired consumption and desired investment equations. ] d) The authorities are aware of this lack of optimism in the economy, via the Consumer Confidence Survey and the Business Outlook Survey, and fear it will lead to a recession. They decide to act to keep output at its full employment level, Y. i. The government could use its fiscal policy (G and T). Calculate the change required in G and in T (two different cases). . ii. Instead, the central bank could use its monetary policy (M). Calculate the required change in M. B4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks) A small open economy is described by the following equations: C4 = 600 + 0.5(Y - T) - 600r 14 = 400 - 400r NX = 600 - 0.25Y - 50e M4 >= 0.5Y -1000(r + 1°) where Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate, e, is the real exchange rate, 1°, is inflation expectations, T is a lump-sum tax, C 4 is desired consumption, I% is desired investment, NX is net export, and M is the nominal supply of money which is set by the central bank. a) Derive an algebraic expression for the IS and LM curves with the real interest rate, r, on the left-hand side of the equation. Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side. b) Assume the expected inflation rate, 7°, is 5%, the real interest rate, r, is 3%, the real money supply, M/P, is 1000, the domestic and foreign price level, P and Pror, are 1, government spending, G, is 300, and the government budget is balanced. Using your results from part a), find the full employment level of output, Y, and the real exchange rate, e. ce) Assume this economy has a flexible exchange rate regime. The central bank decides to decrease the nominal money supply to 950. Find real output, Y>p, and the real exchange rate, esp, in the Keynesian short-run equilibrium. d) Using the open economy IS-LM-FE framework, show and explain the initial equilibrium, the short-run equilibrium, and the return to the long-run equilibrium.

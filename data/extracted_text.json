In January 2015, 100000 containers\nwere sold at a price of $3 each. In March 2015, 120000 containers are sold at a price of $8 each. Does this\nchange in equilibrium price and quantity violate the “law of demand”?\n\n(a) No, because the law of demand” is not valid.\n\n(b) Not necessarily, because the supply curve could have shifted to the left, leading to an increase in equilib-\nrium price and quantity.\n\n(c) Not necessarily, because the supply curve could have shifted to the right, leading to an increase in equilib-\nrium price and quantity.\n\n(d) Not necessarily, because the demand curve could have shifted to the right, leading to an increase in equi-\nlibrium price and quantity.\n\n(e) Not necessarily, because the demand curve could have shifted to the left, leading to an increase in equilib-\nrium price and quantity.\n\n2. Suppose that the demand and supply curves in the market for apples have the following functional form: Qp =\n250 — 4p and Qs = 10 + p.

A single-price monopolist is currently producing an output level where P = $320, MR = $260, ATC = $280, and\nMC = $200. In order to maximize profits, this monopolist should\n(a) decrease production and increase price.\n(b) produce zero output.\n(c) increase production and reduce price\n(d) not change the output level because the firm is currently at the profit-maximizing output level.\n(e) There is insufficient information to make a recommendation.\n4\n",

If you were told that a firm earns positive accounting profit: and nothing else, what would you know is\ntrue about its economic profit?\n(a) It is positive because whenever accounting profit is positive, so is economic profit.\n(b) It cannot be determined without knowing the firms implicit costs.\n(c) It is zero because all firms earn zero economic profit regardless of the industry.\n(d) It is equal to its accounting profit.\n(e) It is negative because its accounting profit is probably not high enough to earn positive economic\nprofit.\n8. Which is NOT an example of price discrimination through the hurdle method?\n(a) All senior citizens are eligible to receive a 10% discount.\n(b) Those who present a manufacturer’s coupon get $5 off the price.\n(c) Those who are willing to wait for periodic sales get lower prices.\n(d) Slightly different product versions are available at different prices.\n(e) All of the above are examples of the hurdle method.\n13\n\n\n9. Cassie runs a door-to-door window-washing service. When she identifies that some of her current\ncustomers are high-income customers to whom she can profitably raise prices, she does so while keeping\nthe price for her other customers unchanged. Some of her existing consumers, now paying the higher\nprice, stop enlisting her services or use them more sparingly, while others continue to use her services\nas before but at the higher price. Her remaining customers continue to use Cassie’s services in the\nsame quantity at the pre-existing price.

For each chosen statement, explain why the\nstatement is True, False or Uncertain. A diagram and(or) a few lines of explanation should be\nsufficient.\n\nUnsupported answers will receive no marks.\n\nB1. Perfect: price discrimination will cause allocative inefficiency.\n\nB2. Consumers will bear a larger burden of a sales tax if demand is relatively elastic and supply\nis relatively inelastic.\n\nB3. Suppose there are only two firms in a special industry. If they each set a high price, they\neach earn $5000. If they each set a low price, they each earn $800. If one firm sets a low price while\nthe other sets a high price, the low-price firm earns $4000 while the high-price firm earns $1000. A\nprisoners’ dilemma exists in the game.\n\nB4. Suppose the government decides, in the interest of “fairness”, to impose a policy prohibit-\ning factor-price differentials. The likely result would be an excess of factors in uses with low net.\nadvantage.\n\nB5. The excess-capacity theorem predicts that long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically com-\npetitive industry occurs with all firms producing at a higher output level than that which minimizes\naverage total costs,\n\nB6. For a perfectly competitive firm, price should equal average cost in the short run, but not\nnecessarily in the long run.\n\n23\n\n\nPart C: PROBLEM SOLVING QUESTIONS\n\nChoose ONE of the following TWO questions.\n\nAnswer all parts and show all your reasoning and calculation.\n\nC1.\n\nSuppose the demand and supply curves for beef in Canada are given by\n\nQ? =155-P\n1\nQ= aP — 10\n\na) Calculate the equilibrium price (P*) and the equilibrium quantity (Q*). Graph the supply\nand demand curves and identify the equilibrium values in a diagram (label all axes and curves,\nidentify the P and Q intercepts).\n\nb) Calculate the elasticity of demand at the equilibrium point in part a). If the supply of beef\nincreased, would total expenditure on beef rise or fall? Explain.\n\nc) Suppose the government imposes a price ceiling of P = 95. What is the new price and\nquantity? What is the excess supply or excess demand with this policy? Show the change in economic\nsurplus from this policy (relative to the free market equilibrium in part a)) in your diagram.\n\nd) Now, suppose the world price for beef is P“ = 120. If the economy (as described in part\na)) opens to trade, does Canada import or export beef? What quantity of beef is traded? Sketch a\ndiagram and identify the consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS) with free trade.\n\ne) Now, suppose the world price for beef is P” = 80 and the government imposes a tariff of\nt = 5 on each unit of beef imported. Sketch a diagram and identify i) the deadweight loss (DWL)\nfrom the tariff relative to free trade, ii) the tariff revenue and iii) the total value of imports.\n\n24\n\n\nC2.\nSuppose a natural monopoly’s total cost and marginal cost are given by\nC=104+15Q\nMC =15\nand it faces (inverse) demand and marginal revenue given by\nP=25-Q\nMR=25-2Q\n\na) Calculate the monopoly price, the monopoly output, and the monopoly profits.\n\nb) Calculate the average total cost at the monopoly output. Graph the demand, marginal\nrevenue (MR), average total cost (ATC), and marginal cost (MC) curves (label all axes and curves).\nAdd the monopoly price and monopoly output from part a) to the graph.\n\nc) Calculate the dead weight loss (DWL) from the monopoly. Identify the area of the deadweight\nloss on your graph.\n\nd) If the government regulates the monopoly with average-cost pricing, what is the price and\noutput? Compare this output to the monopoly output without regulation. Does this policy result\nin allocative efficiency?\n\ne) Suppose demand falls so that the monopoly output is 2.5 and the monopoly price is 17.5. Will\nthe monopoly produce any output in the short run? Will the monopoly produce in the long-run?\nExplain.\n\n25\n",

A diagram and(or) a few lines of explanation should be\nsufficient.\n\nUnsupported answers will receive no marks.\n\nB1. Price discrimination will cause allocative inefficiency.\n\nB2. Producers will bear a larger burden of a sales tax if demand is relatively inelastic and supply\nis relatively elastic.\n\nB3. Suppose there are only two firms in a special industry. If they each set a high price, they\neach earn $10000. If they each set a low price, they each carn $1000. If one firm sets a low price\nwhile the other sets a high price, the low-price firm earns $8000 while the high-price firm earns\n$2000. A prisoners’ dilemma exists in the game.\n\nB4.

Marginal cost is constant at $18 for each unit produced. The firm is currently selling its output at a\nsingle price and allocating its output across segments such that marginal revenue in segment A is $25 and\nmarginal revenue in segment B is $15. How can this firm maximize its profit?\n\nA) maintain the current output and its allocation across segments\nB) decrease the output in segments A and B\nC) decrease the output in segment A and increase the output in segment B\nD) increase the output in segment A and decrease the output in segment B\nE) increase the output in segments A and B\n\n14\n\n\n30) The excess-capacity theorem predicts that\nA) monopolistic firms will achieve positive economic profits by restricting output below the economically\nefficient level at which average total costs are minimized.\nB) all firms in a perfectly competitive industry will produce at a lower output level than that which\nminimizes average total costs.\nC) when price-taking firms maximize their profits by setting price equal to marginal cost, each firm operates\nwith some excess capacity.\nD) profit-maximizing firms will always choose to operate with some degree of excess capacity, in order to be\nflexible in the face of shifts in demand.\nE) long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive industry occurs with all firms producing at a\nlower output level than that which minimizes average total costs.\nThe payoff matrix below shows the payoffs to Firms A and B from producing different levels of output.

Suppose the two firms collude and successfully restrict joint output to that of a\nprofit-maximizing monopolist. As a result, they each realize an increase in their profits. Why would this\ncollusive agreement be difficult to sustain?\n\nA) Because a non-cooperative outcome is inevitable in which output is further restricted and each firm's\nprofit is reduced.\n\nB) Because each firm has an incentive to break the agreement by further restricting output in order to\nincrease the price, thereby increasing their own profits.\n\nC) Because the firm with the lower long-run average costs will be able to capture all sales, driving the\nsecond firm out of the market.\n\nD) Because each firm has an incentive to break the agreement by increasing output in order to increase their\nown profits.\n\ni5\n\n\nThe diagram below shows the demand and supply curves in a perfectly competitive market.\nP;\nSupply = MC\n1\nrr 1\nA : fn\n£ & Competitive\n: on E f Market Price\n2 7\nOA\n' '\n‘ '\n4 i\nPy ' | Demand = MB\n'\n' '\n' td 1\n‘ 2\n0 Q1 Q?

One reason for this is\nA) policymakers came to understand that many oligopolistic firms were producing output levels that\nresulted in allocative efficiency.\nB) policymakers came to understand that many oligopolistic firms were operating at their minimum efficient\nscale, thereby producing an efficient outcome.\nC) policymakers realized that they did not have effective tools for promoting efficiency.\nD) domestic firms are now exposed to more international competition due to falling transportation and\ncommunication costs.\nE) Canada's Competition Bureau, and similar agencies in other countries were so successful at promoting\ncompetition that such regulation is no longer required.\n16\n\n\n35) Suppose there are only two firms (Firms A and B) in Canada that produce good X, and the two firms propose a\nmerger to create a single firm (Firm AB). Is there any circumstance under which the authorities enforcing\nCanadian competition policy might approve of such a merger?\n\nA) According to the Competition Act, if the merged firm enhances the status of a Canadian cultural industry.\nB) According to the Competition Act, as long as the revenues of the merged firm are less than $100 million per\nyear.\nC) If international trade in good X is such that Firm AB faces a fully competitive environment, both within\nand outside of Canada's borders.\nD) If the market is defined as being within Canada's borders, and the merger allows Firm AB to exploit\neconomies of scale.\nThe diagram below shows the MRP curve for a firm producing copper plumbing pipe.

The with-tariff price of identical carpets from the United States is $24. Now\nsuppose a free-trade agreement with the U.S. eliminates the tariff and so the no-tariff price from the U.S. is\n$20. Canada now purchases carpets from the U.S. Is Canada made better off from this trade diversion?\nA) No, because before the agreement Canada was buying from India at a lower (pre-tariff) price and\ncollecting tariff revenue.\nB) Yes, because Canadian consumers are paying less for carpets and consumer surplus has increased.\nC) No, because it would still be cheaper for individual consumers to buy carpets from India.\nD) Yes, because Canada has diverted trade toward the United States.\nE) Canada is not better or worse off. The gain in consumer surplus in Canada is identical to the loss in tariff\nrevenue to the Canadian government.\n19\n\n\nPart B: TRUE/FALSE/UNCERTAIN QUESTIONS\n\nChoose FOUR of the following SIX statements. For each chosen statement, explain why the\nstatement is True, False or Uncertain. A diagram and(or) a few lines of explanation should be\nsufficient.\n\nUnsupported answers will receive no marks.\n\nB1. Price discrimination will cause allocative inefficiency.\n\nB2. Producers will bear a larger burden of a sales tax if demand is relatively inelastic and supply\nis relatively elastic.\n\nB3. Suppose there are only two firms in a special industry. If they each set a high price, they\neach earn $10000. If they each set a low price, they each earn $1000. If one firm sets a low price\nwhile the other sets a high price, the low-price firm earns $8000 while the high-price firm earns\n$2000. A prisoners’ dilemma exists in the game.\n\nB4. Kobe Bryant is a highly paid professional basketball player in the National Basketball\nAssociation. From the perspective of the whole NBA, Kobe Bryant’s economic rent would be very\nsmall, while from the perspective of his individual team it would be very large.\n\nB5. The main difference between a tariff and an “equivalent” voluntary export restriction (VER)\nis: A tariff allows the extra market value of the good to accrue to the supplier, but a VER allows\nthe extra market value to be appropriated by the government of the importing country.\n\nB6. For a perfectly competitive firm, price should equal average cost in the short run, but not\nnecessarily in the long run.\n\n20\n\n\nPart C: PROBLEM SOLVING QUESTIONS\n\nChoose ONE of the following TWO questions.\n\nAnswer all parts and show all your reasoning and calculation.\n\nC1.\n\nSuppose the demand and supply curves for milk in Canada are given by\n\nQP? =200-2P\n1\n= aP-8\n\na) Calculate the equilibrium price (P*) and the equilibrium quantity (Q*).

If the supply of milk\ndecreased, would total expenditure on milk rise or fall? Explain.\n\nc) Suppose the government imposes a quota of 30 units (Q = 30). What is the new price? Show\nthe change in consumer surplus from this policy (relative to the free market equilibrium in part a))\nin your diagram.\n\nNow, suppose the world price for milk is PW = 20.\n\nd) If the economy (as described in part a)) opens to trade, does Canada import or export milk?\nWhat quantity of milk is traded?

Identify the area of the deadweight\nloss on your graph.\n\nd) If the government regulates the monopoly with average-cost pricing, what is the price and\noutput? Compare this output to the monopoly output without regulation. Does this policy result\nin allocative efficiency?\n\ne) Suppose demand falls so that the monopoly output is 10 and the monopoly price is 7. Will\nthe monopoly produce any output in the short run?

A diagram or(and) a few lines of explanation should be enough. No credit is\ngiven for unsupported answers.\nAnswer FOUR of the following SIX questions. Each question is worth 5 marks.\nB1. If Canada can produce 4 cars or 2 trucks with 1 unit of resource, and the US can\nproduce 8 cars or 2 trucks with one unit of resource, there are no potential gains from\ntrade, because the US is better at producing both goods.\nB2. A decrease in the demand of money reduces Canadian interest rates and leads to\nan outflow of financial capital. This causes the Canadian dollar to appreciate.\nB3. If wages are downwardly sticky, the economy’s adjustment process is fast and\nwill quickly eliminate a recessionary gap.\nB4, A demand shock that is validated will produce temporary inflation, and the\neconomy eventually restores potential GDP and stable prices.\nB5. Suppose an economy is currently operating with a recessionary gap, this\neconomy will not return to its long run equilibrium without some policy response.\nB6. In an open economy like Canada’s, a policy-induced increase in the government's\nbudget deficit tends to crowd out foreign capital investments and increase net\nexports.\n\n: 18\n\n\nPart C: Problem-solving Questions (20 marks)\n\nAnswer ONE of the following TWO questions.\n\nRead each part of the question very carefully. Answer all parts and show all the steps of your\n\ncalculations to get full credit. Use diagrams when required.\n\nC1\n\nConsider the following aggregate expenditure model of the economy:\n\nC=75+0.9Yd\n1=80\n\nG=50\nT=0.2Y\n\nX= 60\nM=5+0.12Y\n\nWhere C is consumption, Yd is disposable income, I is investment, G is government\n\nexpenditures on goods and services, T is tax net of transfers, X is exports, M is imports\n\nand Y is national income.\n\n(A)Solve for aggregate expenditures (AE) as a function of Y and calculate the equilibrium\nlevel of national income.

A diagram or(and) a few lines of explanation should be enough. No credit is\ngiven for unsupported answers.\nAnswer FOUR of the following SIX questions. Each question is worth 5 marks.\nB1. If Canada can produce 4 cars or 2 trucks with 1 unit of resource, and the US can\nproduce 8 cars or 2 trucks with one unit of resource, there are no potential gains from\ntrade, because the US is better at producing both goods.\nB2. A decrease in the demand of money reduces Canadian interest rates and leads to\nan outflow of financial capital. This causes the Canadian dollar to appreciate.\nB3. If wages are downwardly sticky, the economy’s adjustment process is fast and\nwill quickly eliminate a recessionary gap.\nB4, A demand shock that is validated will produce temporary inflation, and the\neconomy eventually restores potential GDP and stable prices.\nB5. Suppose an economy is currently operating with a recessionary gap, this\neconomy will not return to its long run equilibrium without some policy response.\nB6. In an open economy like Canada’s, a policy-induced increase in the government's\nbudget deficit tends to crowd out foreign capital investments and increase net\nexports.\n\n: 18\n",

If Canada can produce 4 cars or 2 trucks with 1 unit of resource, and the US can produce 8 cars\nor 3 trucks with one unit of resource, there are no potential gains from trade, because the US is\nbetter at producing both goods.\nB2. In an economy subject to aggregate demand shocks, a fixed exchange rate amplifies these\nshocks and increases the impact of these shocks on output and employment. (Diagram Required)\nB3. For a government to reduce the budget deficit they must run a primary surplus. (Formula\nRequired).\nB4, Under the New Keynesian theory of long-run employment relationships, wage rates adjust\ninstantaneously in excess labor demand or excess labor supply situations.\nBS. Suppose an economy is currently operating with a recessionary gap, this economy will not\nreturn to its long run equilibrium without some policy response.\nBé.

If Canada can produce 4 cars or 2 trucks with 1 unit of resource, and the US can produce 8 cars\nor 3 trucks with one unit of resource, there are no potential gains from trade, because the US is\nbetter at producing both goods.\nB2. In an economy subject to aggregate demand shocks, a fixed exchange rate amplifies these\nshocks and increases the impact of these shocks on output and employment. (Diagram Required)\nB3. For a government to reduce the budget deficit they must run a primary surplus. (Formula\nRequired).\nB4, Under the New Keynesian theory of long-run employment relationships, wage rates adjust\ninstantaneously in excess labor demand or excess labor supply situations.\nBS.

Each firm has\na U-shaped average cost curve where the minimum of average cost occurs\nat an output of 5 million units and where the value of minimum average\ncost is $8/unit. Market demand for the good is given by Q>=8000-10P,\nwhere demand is measured in millions of units and P is market price.\nDetermine the long run equilibrium price, output per firm, market output,\nand the number of firms in the long-run equilibrium.\n\n\nPage 7 of 12 pages\nc) In the short-run, the supply curve of a perfectly competitive industry is the\nhorizontal summation of the individual firm supply curves.

Consider a duopoly that faces a market demand given by P=20,000-10Q, where P is\nproduct price and Q is market output. The two firms in the market have cost\nstructures as follows: firm 1 has costs given by Ci= 4000qi, while firm two has costs\ngiven by C2=400qo, where subscripts indicate the respective firms. The output in the\nmarket is equal to the sum of the firm outputs.\n\na) Solve for the Cournot equilibrium values of price, market output and firm\noutputs.\n\n\nPage 8 of 12 pages\nb) Suppose firm 2 chooses its output level first and firm 1 follows.

She has hired Jen to be her personal manager and help bring\nin endorsements. Jen has offered Sara two options for payment: a flat fee of $120,000 or 20% of\nthe endorsement revenue. Jen will expend resources to help Sara and has two choices: a low\neffort level that will cost Jen $20,000 and bring in $700,000 in revenue and a high effort level\nthat costs Jen $50,000 and brings in $1,200,000 in revenue.

Calculate the payoffs to each player and display it in a two by two payoff\nmatrix.\n\nb) The game is played sequentially. Sara first chooses her payment option and then Jen chooses\nher effort level. Before they sign the contract, Jen tells Sara that Jen is very committed to\nworking hard on Sara’s behalf, regardless of which payment option is chosen. Draw an extended\nform game.

        "Section A: Five questions, each worth 5 marks, for a total of 25 marks.\n\n1. A firm has a production function given by Q = MIN {L; 5K}. Over time, the production\nfunction evolves to become Q = MIN {2L ; 10K}. Show that this represents technological\nprogress.\n\n2. Consider the following statement: “A firm uses labour and capital to produce output\naccording to a Cobb-Douglas technology. A decrease in the wage rate will lead the firm to use\nmore labour and less capital and to produce the given output at a lower cost.” Explain and\nillustrate whether this statement is true, false or uncertain.\n\n3. A monopolist faces a market demand function given by P = 8 — Q. Assume you know\nnothing about the cost structure of the firm. Would the monopolist ever choose to sell 5 units of\noutput? Can you even determine the answer? Explain.\n\n4. Art produce tables, T, in his workshop using labour and capital according to the\nproduction function T = L!’K. In the short run Art uses 16 units of capital equipment at a cost of\n$500 per unit. The next best use of Art’s time is a job that pays him $40 per hour. Derive Art’s\nshort run production function, his demand for labour, and his short run total cost function.\nSection B: Five problems, each worth 15 marks, for a total of 75 marks. Each part of each\nquestion is worth five marks.\n\nl. A perfectly competitive firm has a production function given byQ = L!?K!?, where q\nis output, L is labour and K is capital.\n\na) Derive the conditional input demand functions of the firm.12 pages\n\nb) Derive the long-run total cost function for the firm. Sketch the long run cost\ncurve, labelling at least three point on it assuming the wage rate is 25 and the rental rate is 64.\n\nc) In the short-run, the firm uses 8 units of capital. Derive the firm’s short-run\ndemand for labour and its short-run total cost function. Given a product price of P, derive the\nshort-run supply function of the firm.\n\n2. The long-run cost function of a firm in a perfectly competitive market is given by\nC(q)=200q-10q?+.5q>, where q is firm output. Market demand is given by Q?=20,000-10P,\nwhere Q is market output and P is price.\n\na) Solve for the long-run equilibrium values of price, output per firm, the number of\nfirms and market output.\n\nb) Suppose that market demand increases by 4,500 units at each price. Solve for the\nnew equilibrium values of price, output, output per firm and number of firms in the long-run\nequilibrium.\n",
        "c) Return to the original demand function used in part a). Now suppose that a change\nin tastes means that consumers are willing to pay $100 more for each unit of the good. Solve for\nthe new equilibrium values of price, output, output per firm and the number of firms in long run\nequilibrium.\n\n3. Consider a duopoly that faces a market demand given by P=12,000-60Q, where P is product\nprice and Q is market output. The two firms in the market have cost structures as follows: firm\n1 has costs given by C:= 600qi, while firm two has costs given by C2=400qz2, where subscripts\nindicate the respective firms. The output in the market is equal to the sum of the firm outputs.\n\na) Solve for the Cournot equilibrium values of price, market output and firm outputs.\n\nb) Suppose firm 1 chooses its output level first and firm 2 follows. Solve for\ntheStackelberg equilibrium values of price, market output and firm outputs.\n\nc) Draw the two reaction functions and clearly label the Cournot outcome and the\nStackelberg outcome. Explain the rationale for the Cournot outcome. Why does the stackelberg\nout come differ (think in terms of the leader’s behaviour).\n\n4. The market for food processors is perfectly competitive and characterized by an inverse\ndemand function of the form P = 700 — 10Q and an inverse supply function of the form P = 10Q\n- 300.\n\na) Determine the equilibrium values of price and quantity in the market and calculate the\nelasticities of demand and supply at the equilibrium.\n\nb) The government decides to offer a subsidy on food processors at the rate of $100 per unit.\nCalculate the new equilibrium prices and output level and explain how the subsidy is shared\nbetween producers and consumers. Relate this division of the burden to the elasticities calculated\nin part a)\n\nc) Now suppose that consumers are willing to buy 50 more units at each price. Determine the\nnew equilibrium values of price and quantity.\n\n5.a) Sara is an up and coming sports star with a pro contract. She wishes to leverage her pro\nstatus by bringing in endorsements. She has hired Jen to be her personal manager and help bring\nin endorsements. Jen has offered Sara two options for payment: a flat fee of $120,000 or 20% of\nthe endorsement revenue. Jen will expend resources to help Sara and has two choices: a low\neffort level that will cost Jen $20,000 and bring in $700,000 in revenue and a high effort level\nthat costs Jen $50,000 and brings in $1,200,000 in revenue. In this two by two game, Sara’s\npayoffs are her endorsement revenues less Jen’s fees and Jen’s payoffs are her fees from Sara\nless her resource costs. Calculate the payoffs to each player and display it in a two by two payoff\nmatrix.\n\nb) The game is played sequentially. Sara first chooses her payment option and then Jen chooses\nher effort level. Before they sign the contract, Jen tells Sara that Jen is very committed to\nworking hard on Sara’s behalf, regardless of which payment option is chosen. Draw an extended\nform game. Solve the game and explain the reasoning behind the outcome. Was the promise Jen\nmade to Sara credible? Briefly explain.\n\nc) Team A and Team B are competing in the following game: There are 25 flags planted on a\nbeach. On its turn a team can take 1, 2, 3, or 4 flags. The team that takes the last flag wins. Team\nA chooses first. You are the captain of Team B. Using backward induction, devise and explain a\nstrategy that guarantees your team will win.\n"

The Neoclassical growth model (20 marks)\nConsider an economy with the following aggregate production function:\n\nY, = AK&EP Ni?\n\nwhere Y, is aggregate output, A represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock, N; is\nthe number of workers in the economy, and E is the quantity of energy. Total factor productivity, A, and\nenergy, E, are fixed (constant). The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at rate d, and the\nhouseholds save a constant fraction s of their income.\n\na) Lety, = “, k= = , and e, = 7 Derive the intensive form of the production function in per\n\nC t\nworker terms. Show your steps.\n\nb) Suppose the steady state investment for this economy is: ] = (n + d)K. Find an expression for\nthe capital-labour ratio in the steady state.\n\nc) Derive an algebraic expression for the Golden Rule level of capital per worker, kg. For what\nsaving rate (s) will the steady-state level of capital per worker equal the Golden Rule level of\ncapital per worker?\n\nd) Now assume there is a massive storm and 25% of the energy grid becomes unusable. In other\nwords, this 25% is no longer available for production. Find the new steady-state capital-labour\nratio. Show on a graph and explain the transition between the old and the new equilibrium.\n\n\nPage 8 of 10\nB.2 Equilibrium in Labour Market (20 marks)\nSuppose we have an economy with the following aggregate production function: Y = K*(AN)* + EY\nY stands for output, K for the capital stock, N for the number of people employed in production, F for the\nquantity of energy used in production, and A for a measure of labour efficiency. The coefficients a, 8 and\ny are parameters whose values are between 0 and 1. Suppose a = 8 = y = 0.5.\n\na) Based on the production function, derive an algebraic expression for the demand for labour,\nassuming that w is the real wage. Be sure to sub in the values for a and f as this will simplify your\nfinal relationship.\n\nb) Now suppose that the supply curve is upward-sloping and has the following form:\n\nNi =w\ni. Find an algebraic equation for the equilibrium real wage, #, and equilibrium employment, NV.\nii. Now suppose, A = 4; K = 16; and E= 1. Compute the values for the equilibrium real wage, W,\nequilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output, Y. Use 2 decimals if needed.\n\nc) Suppose there is a negative supply shock and A decreases to 3. Find the new values for the\nequilibrium real wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output,\nY. Use 2 decimals if needed. Also, show this shock using 2 graphs: one for the labour market and\nanother for the production function.\n\nd) Instead of the supply shock of part c), let’s suppose the country invest heavily in energy\ninfrastructure and the quantity of energy quadruple, E = 4. Find the new values for the equilibrium\nreal wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output, Y. Use 2\ndecimals if needed.\n\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\nB.3 Closed economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of a closed economy\n\nCc? =20+0.5(Y —T) —100r Desired consumption\n\n14 = 25—100r Desired investment\n\nY=C4+I7+G Equilibrium\n\nM4/P =5+0.5Y — 200(r + 7°) Real money demand\n\nIn the above, Y is real output, T is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate, 7° is\n\nexpected inflation and P is the price level. Note that r + 7° is the nominal rate of interest and that the\n\ncentral bank controls the money supply (). As well, note that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on\ndesired consumption and investment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your\ncalculations.\n\na) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the AD\ncurve with Y on the left-hand side. Be sure to include inflation expectations (7°).\n\nb) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 41; the price level is 1; the\nlevel of taxation is 30; the budget is balanced; and expected inflation is 2%, which in turn is the central\nbank’s inflation target. Based on this, find the level of full-employment output and then the real rate\nof interest.\n\nc) Recently, Canada along with other economies has been experiencing inflation problems. Using the\nmodel here, suppose that 7° rises to 4%, due to news about impending temporary supply disruptions.\nNote the FE curve is not affected. Assuming that the central bank keeps the nominal money supply\nunchanged, calculate what happens to output and the real interest rate in the short run. [Hint: Use the\nZS curve to find the new real rate of interest.]\n\nd) In the face of the increase in expected inflation, the Bank of Canada decides to keep the money supply\nunchanged and let the economy adjust back to equilibrium. Rewrite your AD curve with the price level\non the left-hand side and then calculate what happens to the price level as the economy moves back to\nthe equilibrium level of output that you found in b). Briefly describe the mechanism driving the\neconomy back to equilibrium. As well, suppose that it takes three years for the economy to adjust back\nto equilibrium. What is the annual inflation rate? Is the rate above the Bank’s target 2% target?\n\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\nB4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe economy in question is small and takes the world rate of interest (r”) as given. It can be described\n\nby the following equations:\n\nC4 =18 + 0.6(Y —T) — 100r” Desired consumption\n\n14 = 19-100r” Desired investment\n\nNX4 = 10—0.1Y — 3e Desire net exports\n\nY=C4+1974+G+4NX4 Equilibrium\n\nM?4/P =7.5 + 0.5Y —200r” Real money demand\n\n€ = CnomP/Pror Real exchange rate\n\nAs above, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and\n\ninvestment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations.\n\na) Your first task is to derive expressions for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand sides of your\nequations. Now use those two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with Y on the\nleft-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side. You will be working with these two equations\nplus those for net export and real exchange rate above.\n\nb) You are given the following information: government spending (G) is 30; the government has a deficit\nof 5; the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5; and the real money supply (M#/P) is 45. Find first the level of\noutput, which you are to assume is the economy’s long-run equilibrium level, as well as the world real\nrate of interest (r”). Next assume that the nominal money supply (M4) is 54, use your price level\nequation to calculate the price level. If the foreign price level (Pro) is 1, what is the level of the\nnominal exchange rate (€n9.,)? Find as well, the level of net exports.\n\nc) Assume that this economy has adopted a fixed exchange rate system and that the nominal exchange\nrate, €nom, is pegged at the level you found in b). Use your model to find the short-run effect on output\nof a rise in government spending from 30 to 32. Note that the government deficit also rises as taxes\nremain constant at the level found in b). Use your model to calculate what has happened to the money\nsupply in the short run and explain why. In the long, the economy must return to equilibrium. Describe\nwhat has to happen to net exports in equilibrium given the increase in government spending. Based on\nthis, use the net export equation to find the new level of the real exchange rate and the new level of\nthe domestic price level.\n\nd) Now assume that this economy has adopted a flexible exchange rate system; that is, the nominal\nexchange rate, @nom, will now do the adjusting. Based on the class discussion, use the TS-I.M-FE\ndiagrams to describe what would happen in the short and long run when the government raises\nspending from 30 to 32. As well, calculate what would happen to the nominal exchange rate to restore\nequilibrium.\n",

Rewrite your AD curve with the price level\non the left-hand side and then calculate what happens to the price level as the economy moves back to\nthe equilibrium level of output that you found in b). Briefly describe the mechanism driving the\neconomy back to equilibrium. As well, suppose that it takes three years for the economy to adjust back\nto equilibrium. What is the annual inflation rate? Is the rate above the Bank’s target 2% target?\n",
        "Page 10 of 10\n\nB4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe economy in question is small and takes the world rate of interest (r”) as given. It can be described\n\nby the following equations:\n\nC4 =18 + 0.6(Y —T) — 100r” Desired consumption\n\n14 = 19-100r” Desired investment\n\nNX4 = 10—0.1Y — 3e Desire net exports\n\nY=C4+1974+G+4NX4 Equilibrium\n\nM?4/P =7.5 + 0.5Y —200r” Real money demand\n\n€ = CnomP/Pror Real exchange rate\n\nAs above, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and\n\ninvestment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations.\n\na) Your first task is to derive expressions for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand sides of your\nequations. Now use those two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with Y on the\nleft-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side. You will be working with these two equations\nplus those for net export and real exchange rate above.\n\nb) You are given the following information: government spending (G) is 30; the government has a deficit\nof 5; the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5; and the real money supply (M#/P) is 45. Find first the level of\noutput, which you are to assume is the economy’s long-run equilibrium level, as well as the world real\nrate of interest (r”). Next assume that the nominal money supply (M4) is 54, use your price level\nequation to calculate the price level. If the foreign price level (Pro) is 1, what is the level of the\nnominal exchange rate (€n9.,)? Find as well, the level of net exports.\n\nc) Assume that this economy has adopted a fixed exchange rate system and that the nominal exchange\nrate, €nom, is pegged at the level you found in b). Use your model to find the short-run effect on output\nof a rise in government spending from 30 to 32. Note that the government deficit also rises as taxes\nremain constant at the level found in b). Use your model to calculate what has happened to the money\nsupply in the short run and explain why. In the long, the economy must return to equilibrium. Describe\nwhat has to happen to net exports in equilibrium given the increase in government spending. Based on\nthis, use the net export equation to find the new level of the real exchange rate and the new level of\nthe domestic price level.\n\nd) Now assume that this economy has adopted a flexible exchange rate system; that is, the nominal\nexchange rate, @nom, will now do the adjusting. Based on the class discussion, use the TS-I.M-FE\ndiagrams to describe what would happen in the short and long run when the government raises\nspending from 30 to 32. As well, calculate what would happen to the nominal exchange rate to restore\nequilibrium.\n"

Long Run Economic Growth in the Solow model (20 marks)\nConsider an economy with the following aggregate production function:\n¥, = AKEN}-*\nwhere Y, is aggregate output, A, represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock,\nand N; is the number of workers in the economy. The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at\nrate d, and the households save a constant fraction, s, of their income.\na) Let y, = Ad and k, = = . Derive the intensive form of the production function in per worker terms.\nt t\nShow your steps.\nb) Derive an algebraic expression for the level of investment per worker and saving per worker in a\nsteady-state equilibrium. Also, find the expression for the capital-labour ratio in the steady state. With\nthe aid of the diagram, show that this equilibrium point is stable. Briefly explain your reasoning.\nc) Now, suppose there are two economies (A and B) that are described by the intensive form of the\nproduction function found in part a). The two economies are identical in all respects except that A has a\nhigher savings rate than B: s, > Sg. Explain using a diagram what this implies for the relative steady-\nstate levels of capital and output per worker in each country.\nd) Suppose that, in addition to having a higher savings rate, economy A also has a higher population\ngrowth rate than economy B: s, > Sg and ny > ng. Is it possible that both economies have the same\nsteady-state output per worker? Explain with the aid of a diagram.\nB2. Asset market equilibrium (20 marks)\nSuppose that the real money demand function is given by\nma\n>= L(Y,r+x°) = 7004+0.1Y — 5000 (r+ 7°)\nwhere M?@ is the nominal money balances demanded, P is the price level, Y is total output, r is the real\ninterest rate, and 7° is the expected inflation rate.\n\n\nPage 7 of 9\na) Assuming that the asset market is currently in equilibrium at r = 0.05. Calculate the nominal money\nsupply, MS, if Y = 2000, P = 2 and 1° = 0.05. What is the velocity of money in this economy? What\nis the value of k in the quantity theory of money?\nb) Assume that the quantity theory of money holds and that velocity is constant at the level you found in\npart a). In this same economy, the central bank fixes the nominal money supply (M*) at 500. With\noutput fixed at its full-employment level (Y = 2000) and assuming that prices are flexible, what will be\nthe new price level? What happens to the price level if the nominal money supply rises to 600?\nc) Now, suppose the central bank follows a money supply rule. In particular, it sets the money supply\naccording to:\nMS = 1000 + 0.1Y — 4000z.\nIf expected inflation equals actual inflation 7 = 1° = 0.03, Y = 1000, and r = 0,02, calculate the price\nlevel in equilibrium using the real money demand function in part a).\nd) Now, suppose that the new real money demand function is given by:\nmé y?\nPP (r+?)\n\nWhat are the elasticities of real money demand with respect to real income and the nominal interest rate,\nrespectively? Briefly explain what they mean.\nB3. The closed economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\nA closed economy is described by the following equations:\n\nc4 = 450 + 0.5(Y — T) — 500r\n\n14 = 300 — 500r\nMa\n>= 50+ 0.5Y — 1000(r + 2°)\n\n\nPage 8 of 9\n\nwhere Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate, 7°, is inflation expectations, T is a\nlump-sum tax, C4, is desired consumption, I 4 is desired investment, and M is the nominal supply of\nmoney which is set by the central bank.\na) Derive an algebraic expression for the IS and LM curves with the real interest rate, r, on the left-hand\nside of the equation. Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side.\nb) Assume the expected inflation rate, 1°, is 5%, the real money supply, M /P, is 500, the price level, P,\nis 1, government spending, G, is 200, and the government has a budget deficit of 100. Using your results\nfrom part a), find the full employment level of output, Y, and the real interest rate, r.\nc) Now assume there is a temporary negative productivity shock and the new full employment level of\noutput, ¥>, is now 1300. Find the price level, P, as well as the real interest rate, r, in the long run. Show\ngraphically and explain the transition between the old and the new long-run equilibria.\nd) One of the goals of the Bank of Canada is to keep inflation low and stable. Calculate the new level of\nnominal money supply, M, required to avoid the change in the price level, P, found in part c). In other\nwords, the Bank of Canada wants to keep the price level at 1 in the long run.\nB4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\nA small open economy is described by the following equations:\n\nC4 = 900 + 0.5(Y — T) — 1000r\n\n1? = 600 — 1000r\n\nNX = 900 — 0.25Y — 400e\n\nM4\n\n>= 0.5Y — 2000(r + 2°)\nwhere Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate, e, is the real exchange rate, 7°, is\ninflation expectations, T is a lump-sum tax, C 4 is desired consumption, /* is desired investment, NX is\nnet export, and M is the nominal supply of money which is set by the central bank.\n\n\nPage 9 of 9\n\na) Derive an algebraic expression for the IS and LM curves with the real interest rate, r, on the left-hand\nside of the equation. Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side.\nb) Assume the expected inflation rate, 7°, is 5%, the real money supply, M/P, is 1000, the domestic and\nforeign price level, P and Py,,, are 1, the nominal exchange rate, €nom, is 2, government spending, G, is\n450, and the government budget is balanced. Using your results from part a), find the full employment\nlevel of output, Y, and the world interest rate, r”.\nc) Assume this economy has a flexible exchange rate regime. The central bank has decided to increase\nthe nominal money supply to 1080. Find real output, Ysp, and the real exchange rate, esp, in the\nKeynesian short-run equilibrium. Also, show graphically and explain the initial equilibrium, the short-\nrun equilibrium, and the return to the long-run equilibrium.\nd) “Consumer sentiment (confidence) falls.” Using the open economy IS-LM-FE framework, show\ngraphically and explain how the change in consumer expectations, highlighted in this headline, would\nimpact the economy if the economy had:\n\ni. A flexible exchange rate regime.\n\nii. A fixed exchange rate regime.\nMake sure to show the initial equilibrium (assume the economy is initially in general equilibrium), the\nshort-run equilibrium, and the return to the long-run equilibrium. /Note: No calculations needed].\n",

What actions could\nthe central bank take to attain this objective?\n\nd) Does the quantity theory of money hold in this economy; that is does MV= PY? State your\nreason by considering the new levels of nominal money supply, real output, and price using\nthe growth rates from part ¢).\n\nB.3 Closed economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of a closed economy\n\nC4 = 144 0.75(Y —T) - 80r Desired consumption\n\nI* =18-60r Desired investment\n\nY=C4+17+G Equilibrium in the goods market\n\nM/P=7+0.5(Y —T) —140(r) Real money supply is equal to demand\n\nIn the above, Y is real output, 7 is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate\n\nand P is the price level. Note that 2° = 0, so that the nominal rate of interest is equal to the real\n\nrate and that the central bank controls the nominal money supply (14). As well, note that the sum\nof the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money\ndemand, a feature that will simplify your calculations of the aggregate demand curve.\n\na) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the\nAD curve, also with Y on the left-hand side. Note that, different for the classroom version, the\ndemand for money is related to affer-tax income. Looking at the JS and LM curves, discuss (no\ncalculations required) what would happen to each curve if the level of taxation were to fall?\nBriefly explain why.\n\nb) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 40; the price level is 1,\nthe level of taxation is 20; and the government has a budgetary surplus of 5. Based on this, find\nthe level of full-employment output (Y) and then the real rate of interest (7).\n\n\n9 of 10\n\nc) With an election pending, the government is coming under pressure to do something about its\nsurplus. One group wants the level of taxation to be reduced to the level of government\nspending, while the other wants government spending to be raised to match current levels of\ntaxation.

You\nare to assume that the nominal money supply stays constant at 40.\n\nd) As prime minister, you have to make a decision. Using your answers from part ¢, suppose that\na significant proportion of the population is young and they are worried about overall demand\nconditions, in other works, employment prospects. On the other hand, there is an older group\nthat wants less government spending, with minimal effects on interest rates. Both groups are\nhappy to have a balanced budget in place. Based on your model, which alternative appeals to\neach group.\n\nB.4 The open economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of an open economy:\n\nc4 =2+0.80Y — 80r” Desired consumption\n\n14 = 13-60r” Desired investment\n\nNX4 =12-0.1Y —2e Desired net exports\n\nY=C4+1*+G6+4NX4 Equilibrium in the goods market\n\nM/P=12+0.5Y —140r” Real money supply is equal to demand\n\n€ = €nomP /Pror Real exchange rate\n\nAs in Question B.3, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired\n\nconsumption and investment is equal to that on money demand, a feature that will simplify your\n\ncalculations. For simplicity, taxation is zero — one less thing to worry about.\n\na) Use the above model to find equations for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand side\nin each case. Now use these two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with\nY on the left-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side.\n\nb) You are given the following values for key variables: government spending (G) is 10; the real\nmoney supply (//P) is 50; and the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5. Find the level of output, the\nworld real rate of interest (r”) and the trade balance (NX). Assuming that the level of output\nyou found is the economy’s equilibrium level and given that M = 50, find the equilibrium\nprice level. Finally suppose that the price level in the foreign country (Pror) is 0.6; what is the\nlevel of the nominal exchange rate (€nom)?\n\n\n10 of 10\n\nc) Assume that the exchange rate is flexible and that the central bank, worried about the high level\nof prices compared with the foreign country, decides to lower the level of the money supply\n(M) from 50 to 48. Find the short-run effect on the level of output (Y), the real and nominal\nexchange rate (e and énom) and net exports (NX) and then the long-run effect of this policy on\nthese variables.\n\n[Hint: To find the short-run effect on output, use the LM curve and then proceed to the JS curve\nto find the short-run level of the real exchange rate, e. To find the long-run effect on the\ndomestic price level use the definition of the real exchange rate.]\n\nd) Suppose that the government decides to fix the exchange rate at the nominal value that you\nfound in part b). Note that this assumption implies that the initial real exchange rate is as above,\n1.5. The government still wishes to have a lower price level for competitive reasons but, with\nfixed exchange rates, they cannot use monetary policy. Based on advice from this class, they\ndecide instead to cut government spending from 10 to 9. Use the IS curve that you found in\npart b) to find the short-run level of output, remembering that e is unchanged. From class, you\nknow that the economy will return to its long-run equilibrium level of output but with a lower\nlevel of G and with implications for net exports. Use the net export equation to find the new\nlevel of the real exchange rate. Note you will need to find the new level of the trade balance.\nFinally, based on the definition of the real exchange rate, find the new price level.\n\nComparing the two systems (fixed and flexible exchange rates), which saw the largest fall in\nthe price level?\n",

        "7 of 10\n\nPart B (Long Questions):\n\nB1. The Neoclassical growth model (20 marks)\n\nConsider an economy with the following aggregate production function:\n\n¥, = AKZLP Ne =ea0) Production function\n\nwhere Y; is aggregate output, A represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock,\n\nN, is the number of workers in the economy, and L is the quantity of available land. Total factor\n\nproductivity, A, and tand, L, are fixed (constant). The labour force grows at rate n, capital\n\ndepreciates at rate d, and the households save a constant fraction s of their income.\n\na) Lety, = st, k= pa , and 1, = os Derive the intensive form of the production function in per\n\nt t t\nworker terms. Show your steps.\n\nb) The steady state level of investment for this economy is: = (n + d)K. Find an expression for\nthe capital-labour ratio in the steady state, k**.\n\nc) Derive an algebraic expression for the Golden Rule level of capital per worker, kg. Show\ngraphically this special steady state.\n\nd) Now assume there is an environmental disaster and 10% of the land becomes unusable for\nproduction. Find an equation for the new steady-state capital-labour ratio. Show on a graph\nand explain the transition between the old and the new equilibrium.\n\nB.2 Asset Market (20 marks)\n\nAssume the real money demand function is:\n\nL(Y, i) = 1000 + 0.5Y — 5000(r + 2°) Real money demand\n\nwhere Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate on non-monetary assets, 1° is\n\nexpected inflation.\n\na) Assuming that the asset market is in equilibrium at i = 0.05. Find equilibrium levels of the\nreal money supply, the nominal money supply, and the velocity of money if P = 1, and Y =\n500. (Note: please round your answers to the nearest three decimal places for all parts of this\nquestion.)\n\nb) Find the real income elasticity of money demand at the equilibrium level of money balances\nfound in part a). Explain what it means.\n",
        "8 of 10\n¢) The rate of inflation in this economy is defined as the growth rate of the nominal money supply\nminus an adjustment for the growth rate of real money demand arising from growth in the real\noutput:\nAM AY :\n\nTa Nyy Inflation\nSuppose the central bank has a target inflation rate of 2%, real output growth is 8%, and the\nincome elasticity of real money demand equals the value found in part b). What actions could\nthe central bank take to attain this objective?\n\nd) Does the quantity theory of money hold in this economy; that is does MV= PY? State your\nreason by considering the new levels of nominal money supply, real output, and price using\nthe growth rates from part ¢).\n\nB.3 Closed economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of a closed economy\n\nC4 = 144 0.75(Y —T) - 80r Desired consumption\n\nI* =18-60r Desired investment\n\nY=C4+17+G Equilibrium in the goods market\n\nM/P=7+0.5(Y —T) —140(r) Real money supply is equal to demand\n\nIn the above, Y is real output, 7 is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate\n\nand P is the price level. Note that 2° = 0, so that the nominal rate of interest is equal to the real\n\nrate and that the central bank controls the nominal money supply (14). As well, note that the sum\nof the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money\ndemand, a feature that will simplify your calculations of the aggregate demand curve.\n\na) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the\nAD curve, also with Y on the left-hand side. Note that, different for the classroom version, the\ndemand for money is related to affer-tax income. Looking at the JS and LM curves, discuss (no\ncalculations required) what would happen to each curve if the level of taxation were to fall?\nBriefly explain why.\n\nb) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 40; the price level is 1,\nthe level of taxation is 20; and the government has a budgetary surplus of 5. Based on this, find\nthe level of full-employment output (Y) and then the real rate of interest (7).\n",
        "9 of 10\n\nc) With an election pending, the government is coming under pressure to do something about its\nsurplus. One group wants the level of taxation to be reduced to the level of government\nspending, while the other wants government spending to be raised to match current levels of\ntaxation. Based on your aggregate demand curve, calculate the short-run effect of each policy\non GDP and the real rate of interest. What happens to interest rates in each case and why? You\nare to assume that the nominal money supply stays constant at 40.\n\nd) As prime minister, you have to make a decision. Using your answers from part ¢, suppose that\na significant proportion of the population is young and they are worried about overall demand\nconditions, in other works, employment prospects. On the other hand, there is an older group\nthat wants less government spending, with minimal effects on interest rates. Both groups are\nhappy to have a balanced budget in place. Based on your model, which alternative appeals to\neach group.\n\nB.4 The open economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of an open economy:\n\nc4 =2+0.80Y — 80r” Desired consumption\n\n14 = 13-60r” Desired investment\n\nNX4 =12-0.1Y —2e Desired net exports\n\nY=C4+1*+G6+4NX4 Equilibrium in the goods market\n\nM/P=12+0.5Y —140r” Real money supply is equal to demand\n\n€ = €nomP /Pror Real exchange rate\n\nAs in Question B.3, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired\n\nconsumption and investment is equal to that on money demand, a feature that will simplify your\n\ncalculations. For simplicity, taxation is zero — one less thing to worry about.\n\na) Use the above model to find equations for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand side\nin each case. Now use these two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with\nY on the left-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side.\n\nb) You are given the following values for key variables: government spending (G) is 10; the real\nmoney supply (//P) is 50; and the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5. Find the level of output, the\nworld real rate of interest (r”) and the trade balance (NX). Assuming that the level of output\nyou found is the economy’s equilibrium level and given that M = 50, find the equilibrium\nprice level. Finally suppose that the price level in the foreign country (Pror) is 0.6; what is the\nlevel of the nominal exchange rate (€nom)?\n",
        "10 of 10\n\nc) Assume that the exchange rate is flexible and that the central bank, worried about the high level\nof prices compared with the foreign country, decides to lower the level of the money supply\n(M) from 50 to 48. Find the short-run effect on the level of output (Y), the real and nominal\nexchange rate (e and énom) and net exports (NX) and then the long-run effect of this policy on\nthese variables.\n\n[Hint: To find the short-run effect on output, use the LM curve and then proceed to the JS curve\nto find the short-run level of the real exchange rate, e. To find the long-run effect on the\ndomestic price level use the definition of the real exchange rate.]\n\nd) Suppose that the government decides to fix the exchange rate at the nominal value that you\nfound in part b). Note that this assumption implies that the initial real exchange rate is as above,\n1.5. The government still wishes to have a lower price level for competitive reasons but, with\nfixed exchange rates, they cannot use monetary policy. Based on advice from this class, they\ndecide instead to cut government spending from 10 to 9. Use the IS curve that you found in\npart b) to find the short-run level of output, remembering that e is unchanged. From class, you\nknow that the economy will return to its long-run equilibrium level of output but with a lower\nlevel of G and with implications for net exports. Use the net export equation to find the new\nlevel of the real exchange rate. Note you will need to find the new level of the trade balance.\nFinally, based on the definition of the real exchange rate, find the new price level.\n\nComparing the two systems (fixed and flexible exchange rates), which saw the largest fall in\nthe price level?\n"

(26 points): The five parts have roughly the same number of points.\n\nConsider the following augmented version of the Solow (neoclassical) growth model. Sup-\npose that the relationship between output per worker, y, physical capital per worker, k, and\nhuman capital per worker, h, at any point in time is represented by y = Af(k,h). The\nfunction f is increasing in k and h, and has diminishing marginal product of k. Suppose\nthat A and h are exogenous constants, population growth is n > 0, the savings rate is s, and\nthe rate of depreciation of capital is d > 0.\n\n(1) Explain intuitively why the dynamic evolution of k is described by the equation\n\nAk = sAf(k,h) —(n+4)k.\n\n(2) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*,\nis determined. If the initial value of k is ko < k*, illustrate and explain the process by which\nthe economy converges to the steady state.\n\n(3) IWustrate on a diagram the impact of an increase in the stock of human capital per\nworker, h, on the steady-state level of output per worker. Describe how the economy adjusts\nfrom its original steady state to the new steady state.\n\n(4) Consider two countries that have the same production function\n\ny= Akh?\nand equal values of A = 1, s = 0.2, n = 0.02 and d = 0.08. If country 2 has twice the human\ncapital per worker of country 1, analyze what this implies for the two countries’ relative per\nworker outputs in steady state.\n\n(5) Explain the idea of conditional convergence that is predicted by the Solow model.\nExplain why this prediction need not be inconsistent with the overall pattern of divergence\nin the distribution of relative per capita income observed in the real world.\n\nProblem 3. (26 points): Closed economy IS-LM-FE.\n\nThe following four equations describe a closed economy:\nC4+=19+0.5(Y —T) —100r Desired consumption\nI¢=27-50r Desired investment\nY=Ct?+I4+G Goods market equilibrium\nM=94+06Y —150r Money market equilibrium\n\n~e\n\n\nIn the above, Y is real output, T is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real\nrate of interest, and P is the aggregate price level. Note that in the final equation, M is\nthe money supply (which is under the control of the central bank) and it is set equal to the\ndemand for money. You should also note that the interest-rate coefficients on consumption\nand investment sum to 150, which is equal to the interest-rate coefficient on the money\ndemand equation. This will make deriving the AD curve somewhat less burdensome.\n\n(1) Find the IS and LM curves for the economy, in each case with the real interest rate\non the left-hand side. Derive as well an equation for the aggregate demand, AD, curve, with\nY on the left-hand side.\n\n(2) Suppose that G = 20, M/P = 60 and that the government is running a budgetary\nsurplus of 5. Given this information, find the level of real output, Y , using the AD curve\nfor this economy. Given the level of real output (Y) that you found, use the equation for\nyour LM curve to solve for the real rate of interest, r. You are to assume that the values\nof Y and r that you found are the long-run equilibrium values for this economy. As well,\nassume that the price level is 1, implying that the nominal money supply is 60.\n\n(3) Because of innovations in the financial system, the public is able to economize on its\nholdings for money balances. In your model, this is reflected as a shift down in the demand\nfor real money balances and is captured by having the constant term in the money demand\nequation decline from 9 to 7. Initially the central bank holds the money supply constant\nat 60. Use again your AD curve to find the new level of output. [Hint: In this short-run\nequilibrium, hold the price level, P, constant.]\n\n(4) Using the diagrams familiar to you from class and the course, describe what is hap-\npening. Be sure to compare the new level of output you found with that you found in part\n(2). Based on this comparison, what are the implications for the price level.\n\n(5) Now rewrite your AD curve, with the price level, P, on the left-hand side. Suppose\nthat the economy is now back in equilibrium, with Y = Y , where Y is equal to the level you\nfound in part (2). What has happened to the price level? What process is being illustrated?\n\n(6) Suppose now that the central bank is worried about the inflationary implications of\nthe shift in the money demand equation. What would be the implications for the money\nsupply supposing that the central bank wanted to keep the price level unchanged at the level\nin part (2)?\n\n8\n\n\nProblem 4. (26 points): Open economy IS-LM-FE.\n\nKeeping the equations for C4, J¢, and u the same as in Problem 3 above, suppose that\nthis economy becomes open to trade. To capture this development, an equation for net\nexports, NX*%, has been added. The final equation is the definition of the real exchange\nrate, e. Note that the country is small and takes the world real rate of interest, r” , as given.\n\nC4=19+0.5(Y —T) —100r” Desired consumption\nI¢=27-50r” Desired investment\nY=Ct+I4+G+NxX? Goods market equilibrium\nNX?¢ =21.5-—0.1Y —4e Desired net exports\n\nuy =9+0.6Y — 150r” Money market equilibrium\ne= Sem Real exchange rate\n\n(1) Use the above equations to write out the IS and LM curves for this economy, with\nr” on the left-hand side.\n\n(2) Suppose that the world interest rate is 4% and that the real money supply is 66. Find\nthe level of real output, Y.\n\n(3) The economy is specialized in certain goods and services and, as a result, it has a\nsurplus of 5; that is, NX¢ = 5. Find the level of the real exchange rate, e. If the price level\n(P) in this economy were equal to the foreign price level (Py,,), what would be the level of\nthe nominal exchange rate, €nom?\n\n(4) Assume that the nominal exchange rate is fixed at the level you found in part (3).\nAs well assume that G = 20 and T = 25. Now suppose that the economy is hit with a 25%\ntariff, which in effect will raise the domestic price level, P, by that amount. What is the\nnew level of the real exchange rate?\n\n(5) Now find the new, short-run level of output, assuming that the nominal exchange\nrate is unchanged. To do this, you will have to use your IS curve, but now with output, Y,\non the right-hand side. In percentage terms, by how much has output changed?\n\n(6) Use the diagrams for the IS, LM and FE model to describe what would happen in\nthe long run to output, the domestic price level and the nominal and real exchange rate\nassuming in turn that the economy has fixed and then flexible exchange rates. Note that no\nmath is required for this part.\n",

        "Section B (LONG QUESTIONS): Answer ALL THREE questions.\n\nProblem 2. (26 points): The five parts have roughly the same number of points.\n\nConsider the following augmented version of the Solow (neoclassical) growth model. Sup-\npose that the relationship between output per worker, y, physical capital per worker, k, and\nhuman capital per worker, h, at any point in time is represented by y = Af(k,h). The\nfunction f is increasing in k and h, and has diminishing marginal product of k. Suppose\nthat A and h are exogenous constants, population growth is n > 0, the savings rate is s, and\nthe rate of depreciation of capital is d > 0.\n\n(1) Explain intuitively why the dynamic evolution of k is described by the equation\n\nAk = sAf(k,h) —(n+4)k.\n\n(2) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*,\nis determined. If the initial value of k is ko < k*, illustrate and explain the process by which\nthe economy converges to the steady state.\n\n(3) IWustrate on a diagram the impact of an increase in the stock of human capital per\nworker, h, on the steady-state level of output per worker. Describe how the economy adjusts\nfrom its original steady state to the new steady state.\n\n(4) Consider two countries that have the same production function\n\ny= Akh?\nand equal values of A = 1, s = 0.2, n = 0.02 and d = 0.08. If country 2 has twice the human\ncapital per worker of country 1, analyze what this implies for the two countries’ relative per\nworker outputs in steady state.\n\n(5) Explain the idea of conditional convergence that is predicted by the Solow model.\nExplain why this prediction need not be inconsistent with the overall pattern of divergence\nin the distribution of relative per capita income observed in the real world.\n\nProblem 3. (26 points): Closed economy IS-LM-FE.\n\nThe following four equations describe a closed economy:\nC4+=19+0.5(Y —T) —100r Desired consumption\nI¢=27-50r Desired investment\nY=Ct?+I4+G Goods market equilibrium\nM=94+06Y —150r Money market equilibrium\n\n~e\n",
        "In the above, Y is real output, T is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real\nrate of interest, and P is the aggregate price level. Note that in the final equation, M is\nthe money supply (which is under the control of the central bank) and it is set equal to the\ndemand for money. You should also note that the interest-rate coefficients on consumption\nand investment sum to 150, which is equal to the interest-rate coefficient on the money\ndemand equation. This will make deriving the AD curve somewhat less burdensome.\n\n(1) Find the IS and LM curves for the economy, in each case with the real interest rate\non the left-hand side. Derive as well an equation for the aggregate demand, AD, curve, with\nY on the left-hand side.\n\n(2) Suppose that G = 20, M/P = 60 and that the government is running a budgetary\nsurplus of 5. Given this information, find the level of real output, Y , using the AD curve\nfor this economy. Given the level of real output (Y) that you found, use the equation for\nyour LM curve to solve for the real rate of interest, r. You are to assume that the values\nof Y and r that you found are the long-run equilibrium values for this economy. As well,\nassume that the price level is 1, implying that the nominal money supply is 60.\n\n(3) Because of innovations in the financial system, the public is able to economize on its\nholdings for money balances. In your model, this is reflected as a shift down in the demand\nfor real money balances and is captured by having the constant term in the money demand\nequation decline from 9 to 7. Initially the central bank holds the money supply constant\nat 60. Use again your AD curve to find the new level of output.

Suppose\nthat the economy is now back in equilibrium, with Y = Y , where Y is equal to the level you\nfound in part (2). What has happened to the price level? What process is being illustrated?\n\n(6) Suppose now that the central bank is worried about the inflationary implications of\nthe shift in the money demand equation.

Find the level of the real exchange rate, e. If the price level\n(P) in this economy were equal to the foreign price level (Py,,), what would be the level of\nthe nominal exchange rate, €nom?\n\n(4) Assume that the nominal exchange rate is fixed at the level you found in part (3).\nAs well assume that G = 20 and T = 25. Now suppose that the economy is hit with a 25%\ntariff, which in effect will raise the domestic price level, P, by that amount. What is the\nnew level of the real exchange rate?\n\n(5) Now find the new, short-run level of output, assuming that the nominal exchange\nrate is unchanged. To do this, you will have to use your IS curve, but now with output, Y,\non the right-hand side. In percentage terms, by how much has output changed?\n\n(6) Use the diagrams for the IS, LM and FE model to describe what would happen in\nthe long run to output, the domestic price level and the nominal and real exchange rate\nassuming in turn that the economy has fixed and then flexible exchange rates.

For what saving\nrate (s) will the steady-state level of capital per worker equal the Golden Rule level of capital per worker?\nB2. Asset market equilibrium (20 marks)\nAssume the real money demand function is\nL(Y, i) = 2000 + 0.3¥ — 5000:\n\nwhere Y is real output, P is the price level, i is the nominal interest rate on non-monetary assets, and\nmonetary assets earn no interest.\na) Assuming that the asset market is in equilibrium at i = 0.05. Find the equilibrium levels of the real\nmoney supply, M/P, the nominal money supply, M, and the velocity of money, V, if P = 100, and Y =\n2000.

This implies that the supply of labour is given by:\n\nN° =(1-1)w\nUse the above in conjunction with the demand for labour equation you found in\npart a) to find expressions to the equilibrium real wage.\n\nc) You are given the following: @ = 0.5 and r= 0.25. Use this information to find the\nlevel of labour demand, the real wage and the level of output in this economy.\n\nd) The government has hired a number of “supply-side” economists who convince\nthe finance minister to cut the income tax rate to 0.20 in an effort to increase\nemployment and output. Use your model to find the levels of labour demand and\noutput. Has this policy been effective in increasing employment and output?\n\ne) What has happened to the real wage paid by the employer and the after-tax real\nwage received by workers? Provide a brief explanation of your results focusing\non supply and demand changes.\n\nA.2 Finding investment when depreciation rates can differ (10 marks)\n\nThe production function and the user cost of capital for this economy are\n\nrespectively:\n\nY =5+6K, -0.25K?\nuc=rt+d\n\nNote that there are no taxes and the price of capital has been set equal to one.\n\na) Using the above equations, find an expression for the desired stock of capital and\nhow it relates to the user cost of capital. Based on the capital accumulation\n\n\n3 of 9\nidentity, find an expression for gross investment (7,). Discuss briefly how\ndepreciation affects gross investment.\n\nb) You are given the following information:\n\nK, =10; d =10%; and r =5%\nUse these values to find the desired level of the capital stock as well as gross\ninvestment.\n\nc) Now suppose that the new capital that the firm is purchasing has a lower\ndepreciation rate. You can think of this as new computers that have longer\nbattery lives than the existing ones. For concreteness, suppose that the\ndepreciation rate for new capital is 5%. Find the new levels of the desired capital\nstock and investment.\n\nd) Continue to assume that new capital has a depreciation rate of 5%. At the same\ntime, managers discover that the existing capital stock is actually in better shape\nthan previously thought because of the effectiveness of past repairs. The result is\nthat the depreciation rate on existing capital is now 9%. Based on this\ninformation (and still assuming that new capital’s depreciation rate is 5%), find\nthe new level of investment. How does it compare to the levels you found in\nparts b) and c)? What conclusions do you draw about the effect of each type of\ndepreciation on investment?\n\nA.3 Monetary expansion in a closed economy IS-LM-FE framework (10 marks)\n\nSuppose that the central bank decides to raise the nominal money supply, M. For\n\nsimplicity, assume that the economy is initially in general equilibrium.\n\na) Show the initial general equilibrium point graphically. What is the short-run\neffect of expansionary monetary policy on output and the real interest rate? Also,\nshow this graphically. Label the graph clearly.\n\nb) Consider the economy’s adjustment to the long-run equilibrium. What effect\nfrom the short-run triggers the long-run effects of the policy in the economy?\nBriefly describe how the economy adjusts to the long-run equilibrium and show\nthe effects on output, the real interest rate and employment on the same\ndiagram as part a).\n\nc) What can you conclude about how a change in the nominal money supply affects\nreal economic variables? What is the economic term given to this scenario?\n\n\n40f 9\n\nA.4 Equilibrium in the goods market for both small and open economy\n\n(10 marks)\n\nThe consumption (C*) and investment (/¢) functions of this economy are:\n\nC4=15+0.5 (Y-7)-100r\n4=20-50r\n\na) Government spending is 25 and the budget is balanced. The real interest rate, r,\nis 5%. First assume a closed economy. What is the goods market equilibrium\ncondition? What is the equilibrium level of GDP (Y), consumption (C¢) and\ninvestment (I¢)? Check that the components sum to GDP.\n\nb) Suppose now that the economy is a smal] open economy (i.e. it takes the world\ninterest rate as given). Assume that r = r”= 10% and G = T = 30 while other\nvalues remain unchanged. Also, Y is equal to the value you found in a). Find the\nlevel of savings, investment (/4) and net exports (NX).\n\nc) Is the small open economy a borrower from or a lender to the world?\n\nA.5 Equilibrium in the market for foreign exchange (10 marks)\n\nYou have the option of investing in a Canadian bond that is denominated in\n\nCanadian dollars and pays a nominal interest rate, (i), in one year. The real interest\n\nrate is 1.5% and expected inflation is 1.0%. The other option is to invest in a\n\ncomparable German bond that’s is denominated in euros and pays a nominal\n\ninterest rate, (ig., ), of 4.83% in one year. The nominal (spot) exchange rate, @nom, is\n\n1.10 EUR/$.\n\na) Which bond would be less attractive in the international financial markets? Do\nwe observe an appreciation or a depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the\neuro and why?\n\nb) Based on your answer in part a), what is the effect on German net exports and\nCanadian net exports?\n\nc) The nominal interest parity is given as:\n\n. . €nom\n\n(1 + i) i (1 + iger)\n\nCnom\nWhat would be the forward exchange rate, eh om» for the return on the bonds in\nthe two countries to be equalized? Compared to the spot rates, what does this\nvalue tell you about the expectation of investors regarding the Canadian dollar\nagainst the euro? Give two necessary conditions or assumptions that should be\n\nmet for interest rate parity to hold.\n\nd) Suppose ef om = 1.10 EUR/$. What is en 9m, With the given nominal interest rate\n\nvalues?\n\n\n5 of 9\n\nPart B: Long Questions\n\nDo three (3) out of five (5) for a total of 60 marks\n\nNote: Each question starts on a separate page\n\nB.1 Inter-temporal consumption (20 marks)\n\nThe household under consideration here lives for two periods and receives present\n\nand future income of y,and y,, respectively. While the household has no wealth, it\n\ncan borrow or lend at the market rate of interest, represented by r.\n\na) Based on the above information, write out the household’s budget constraint,\nshowing the relationship between future consumption and _ present\nconsumption, Using your budget constraint, derive the household’s inter-\ntemporal budget constraint.\n\nb) The household’s utility function is given by:\n\nU(c,,c,) = aln(c,) +(1—a@)In(c,)\nIn the above equation, @ is the weight that the household places on present\nconsumption (c,) and (l-q@), the weight on future consumption (c, ).\nRemembering that dinx = ay find first the slope of the utility function (that is:\nx\n\nfind de, /dc,) and then using the budget constraint find a relationship between\nfuture and present consumption.

This implies that the supply of labour is given by:\n\nN° =(1-1)w\nUse the above in conjunction with the demand for labour equation you found in\npart a) to find expressions to the equilibrium real wage.\n\nc) You are given the following: @ = 0.5 and r= 0.25. Use this information to find the\nlevel of labour demand, the real wage and the level of output in this economy.\n\nd) The government has hired a number of “supply-side” economists who convince\nthe finance minister to cut the income tax rate to 0.20 in an effort to increase\nemployment and output. Use your model to find the levels of labour demand and\noutput. Has this policy been effective in increasing employment and output?\n\ne) What has happened to the real wage paid by the employer and the after-tax real\nwage received by workers?

Find the new levels of the desired capital\nstock and investment.\n\nd) Continue to assume that new capital has a depreciation rate of 5%. At the same\ntime, managers discover that the existing capital stock is actually in better shape\nthan previously thought because of the effectiveness of past repairs. The result is\nthat the depreciation rate on existing capital is now 9%. Based on this\ninformation (and still assuming that new capital’s depreciation rate is 5%), find\nthe new level of investment.

Briefly explain the implications of constant returns to scale.\n\nb) Assume now that there are constant returns to scale and that capital’s share in\noutput is 25%, Supposing that the saving rate is 20%, the depreciation rate is 3%\nand the population growth rate is 2%, calculate the steady-state level of capital\nper worker for this economy. Find as well the level of output per worker and\nconsumption per worker in the steady state?\n\nc) Based on the information given in part b) solve for the “Golden-Rule” level of\ncapital per worker and then consumption per worker. How do these values\ncompare to the level of steady-state capital and consumption per worker you\nfound in part b). If the actual saving rate were to rise, would steady-state\nconsumption per worker rise?\n\nA.2 Desired capital stock and investment (10 marks)\n\nSuppose that the expected marginal product of capital is related to K@, the desired\n\nlevel of capital stock, in the following way:\n\nMPK! = 20-—5K@\n\nAs well, suppose that real interest rate is r, the rate of depreciation is d, the effective\n\ntax rate is t and the price of capital is p,. The actual stock of capital currently in\n\nplace, K, is equal to 2.\n\na) Derive an analytical expression for the desired stock of capital (K¢). Using the\nappropriate diagram, discuss briefly how the desired stock is determined. Based\non the expression you found for K?, derive an equation for desired investment\n(/4) in terms of r, d, pg and t.\n\nb) Using the following values r = 4%,t = 5%, Py = 1,andd = 2%, calculate the\ndesired level of capital stock. Based on your findings, find the current level of\ndesired investment?\n\nc) Now assume that the price of capital, the depreciation rate and the real rate of\ninterest were constant. Analyze the effect of fall in the effective tax rate on\ndesired capital stock by using the diagram you developed in part b). How does\nlowering the tax rate affect the level of investment?\n\n\n3 of 9\nA.3 Foreign exchange rate (10 marks)\nAs a Canadian saver, you have $500 Canadian dollars (CAD) and have a choice\nbetween investing in either Canada or the United Kingdom. The one-year nominal\ninterest rate in Canada is 4%, while in the UK it is 3%. Assume that both economies\nhave the same risk levels and liquidity and there are no transaction costs. The\ncurrent nominal exchange rate is e = 0.55 British pounds per Canadian dollar\n(1CAD = 0.55 GBP).\n\na) At the beginning of the year, you are expecting the Canadian dollar to depreciate\nby 3% over the coming year. Based on this forecast, which investing choice yields\nthe higher return?\n\nb) What would your expectation of the future CAD/GBP (e*,,) have to be in order to\neliminate all arbitrage opportunities (that is, to leave you indifferent between\ninvesting in Canada or the UK)?\n\nc) Using the definition of the real exchange rate, under what conditions would\nrelative purchasing power parity (PPP) hold? Assuming flexible exchange rates\nand relative PPP, what would be the implication for the Canadian dollar if the\ninflation rate in Canada were 5% and that in the UK, 6%.\n\nA.4 IS-LM in an open economy (10 marks)\n\nThink of an open economy where for the moment we ignore whether or not we are\n\ntalking about fixed or flexible exchange rates. The economy is small and it takes the\n\nworld real rate of interest as given.\n\na) Now suppose that the economy experiences a positive productivity shock, such\nthat the long-run supply curve shifts to the right.\n\na. Using just diagrams and assuming that the exchange rate is fixed, describe\nbriefly the process by which the economy moves to its new long-run\nequilibrium. What has to happen to the real exchange rate and why?\n\nb. Again, using just diagrams but assuming that the exchange rate is flexible,\ndescribe the process by which the economy moves to its new long-run\nequilibrium. In this case you can assume that the central bank wants to\nkeep the price level constant. What is the effect on the real exchange rate?\n\nb) For long-run equilibrium, does it matter whether the exchange rate regime is\nfixed or flexible? Does the exchange rate regime as well as the monetary policy\nassumptions matter for other variables in the economy? Briefly explain.\n\nNote that you can use the same diagram to describe both adjustment processes.\n\n\n4o0f9\n\nA.5 Labour market equilibrium with minimum wages\n\nThe following is a simplified production function for an industry that employs\n\nminimum-wage workers.\n\nY=AN™*\n\nThe supply of labour for this industry is given by:\n\nNt=w\n\na) Using the above two equations, find an equation for the demand for labour and\nthen another equation for the wage rate. Given 4=128 and a=0.5, find the\nequilibrium demand for labour, the wage rate and the level of output.\n\nSuppose that the level of output that you found in part a) represents the industry's\n\ntotal sales, which are fixed. In other words, the firm cannot increase sales beyond\n\nthis amount. Its only option to improve its profitability is to rely on cost saving or\nproductivity improvements.\n\nb) You are now to consider the effect of the introduction of a minimum wage 5%\nhigher than the equilibrium wage you found in part a). Calculate the effect on the\ndemand for labour? If the labour supply equation remains unchanged, calculate\nthe unemployment rate.\n\nc) You will notice that the policy will create unemployment. In this case, the\ngovernment decides to introduce measures to raise productivity so as to\nencourage firms to hire back the workers who became unemployed at the now\nhigher wage. Use your model to develop an equation that will show by how\nmuch productivity would have to rise in order to achieve that result. Then\ncalculate the desired increase in productivity. In percentage terms, by how much\nwould productivity have to increase to achieve the goal?\n\nd) Consider the unemployment rate that you calculated in part b). Suppose that the\nactual unemployment rate you observe is roughly half the rate you derived from\nyour model. In words, what would explain the difference?\n\n\n5 of 9\n\nPart A: Long Questions\n\nDo three (3) out of five (5) for a total of 60 marks\n\nB.1 Inter-temporal consumption (20 marks)\n\nThe consumer in this question lives for two periods, during which he has to decide\n\nhow much to consume in the present and future (c, and c,) given his budget\n\nconstraint. During the first period he works, receiving an income of y,, while in the\nsecond he is retired and lives off an employer-provided pension equal to 75% of his\n\nfirst-period income. The rate of interest in this economy is r.\n\na) Based on the above information, write out the consumer’s budget constraint,\nshowing the relationship between future consumption (c,) and present\nconsumption (c,), Based on your budget constraint, write out an expression for\nthe consumer’s inter-temporal budget constraint.\n\nb) Suppose that the consumer’s utility function has the following form:\n\nU(e,,c,)=alne, +(1-a)Ine,\nAbove ais the weight that the consumer puts on present consumption.\nRemembering that dInx = = find first the slope of the utility function (that is:\nx\nfind dc, /dc,) and then using the budget constraint find a relationship between\nfuture and present consumption. Using this latter relationship, derive an\nequation for present consumption as it relates to the present value of lifetime\nresources.\nc) You are given the following values for a and the two variables in the model:\na =0.52; y, =105; and r=0.05\nBased on this information, find the values of c,and c, and verify that they satisfy\nthe inter-temporal budget constraint; that is, verify that the PVLC = PVLR.\n\nd) Suppose now that the company for which he works has been quite successful\nand as a result it offers the employees a choice between a one-time payment\ntoday of 5% of their current income (note that this does not affect his current\nincome level) versus a 5 percentage point increase in their pension from 75 to\n80% of their current income, which the consumer will receive in the future. Use\nyour equation to calculate the effect on present and future consumption of each\noption.\n\ne) As the union representative, you are asked to evaluate these two options. Which\none would you choose and why? Would your decision change if the weight on\npresent consumption were less than that on future consumption or if the\ninterest rate rose? [Note: no calculations are required].\n\n\n6 0f9\n\nB.2 Long-run growth and productive government spending (20 marks)\n\nSuppose that the production function takes the following form:\n\nY, = K,“G,8n,-4-F\n\nwhere K; denotes the capital stock, N, labour input and G, government expenditure.\n\nG, can be interpreted as infrastructure or other productive services. Assume that\n\na>0,8>Oanda+ B < 1. Note as well that capital depreciates at rate d and the\n\ngrowth rate of labour is n.\n\nNow assume that government spending is financed with a proportional income tax\n\nat d constant rate t, and savings are a fraction s of after-tax income.\n\nG, = TY,\nS_ = s(%, — G) = s(% - TY.) = s(1-1)Y,\n\nThe capital stock accumulates according to the following equation:\n\nKea — Ky = Ty — dK,\n\na) Express aggregate output, Y,,in terms of capital (K,) and the tax rate (r) by\nsubstituting G, = TY, into the production function and solving for Y,. [Note that\nyour new production function will have capital, the tax rate and labour all on\nthe right hand side.]\n\nb) Write down the intensive form of the production function you derived in part a)\nby expressing the production function in per worker terms, that is define output\n\n: Ye Ke a F ;\nper worker and capital per worker as y; = x k= ra In deriving the intensive\nt t\nform of the production, you will find it useful to bear in mind that:\ndoa-f -@% 18 2\n1-B _ ny 1-By1-B _ yy 1-B\nN, =N,0°N, © =N,O UM,\nFor the rest of the question, set =a and GG = bin the intensive form\nversion of the production function.\n\nc) Derive the law of motion of the capital stock showing how it evolves over time.\n[Hint: Start with the capital accumulation identity and divide both sides by N,14\nusing that J, = S,,and Ni4, = (1+n)N.]\n\nd) Derive the steady-state level of capital per worker, k*.\n\ne) Find the rate of taxation, 1, that can maximize the steady-state level of capital\nper worker, k*.\n\n\n7 of 9\nIn the following three questions, which deal with the IS-LM model, the\nvariables and equations are those familiar to you from the course and\nassociated materials as well as the textbook. They will not be defined here.\nB.3 The closed economy version of the IS-LM model (20 marks)\nConsider a closed economy with the following information:\nc# = 504+0.7(¥ —T) — 500r\n14 = 20 — 300r\nM/P = 0.5Y — 800(r + 1°)\n\na) Derive equations for the IS and the LM curves, with the real rate of interest on\nthe left-hand side. As well, derive an equation for the aggregate demand curve,\nAD, with Y on the left-hand side.\n\nb) Given the following values,G = 80,M =50,P = landa® = 0, and assuming\nthe government budget is balanced, calculate the long-run equilibrium levels of\nY andr for this economy. Find as well the level of C¢ and /¢ and verify that the\ncomponents of GDP add up to the level of Y you found.\n\nFor what follows, you can consider the level of output you found in b) as equal\n\nto the economy's potential output.\n\nc) Suppose that instead of balancing its budget, the government decides to run a\nbudget deficit equal to 5 by keeping its spending constant at G = 80 and\nlowering taxes. (Assume Ricardian Equivalence does not hold and all other\nvariables are held constant.) Calculate the short-run and long-run effects that\nthis would have on Y,r and P. Find the values of C¢ and /@ associated with new\nlong-run equilibrium.\n\nd) Assume that the government reverts to a balanced budget, G = T = 80. Suppose\nnow that 7° rises from 0 to 2%. Calculate the short-run effect that this would\nhave on Y,r and the nominal rate of interest. Calculate what would happen to\nthe price level, P, in the long run if no policy actions were taken.\n\ne} Suppose the government believes that it would take too much time for the price\nlevel to adjust. To return more quickly to long-run equilibrium after the\nincrease in inflation expectations described in part d), calculate by how much\ngovernment spending, G, would have to change, so that in the new long-run\nequilibrium, the price level remains unchanged at 1.\n\n\n8 of 9\n\nB.4 An open economy with flexible exchange rates (20 marks)\n\nThe model you are to consider consists of the following relationships:\n\nC4 =35+0.5(¥ -T)-250r\"\nI? =40-250r\"\nNX4 =25.28-0.1¥ —2e\nci 8+0.8Y -500r\"\nP\name\ne =< 10m\nPron\n\na) Use the above relationships to write out the IS and LM equations for this\neconomy with, in each case, the world real rate of interest on the left hand side.\n\nb) Suppose now that government spending is 10, while the budget is balanced. The\nreal and the nominal money supply are the same at 100, while the real world\nrate of interest (r\") is 4%. Use this information to find the level of output (Y ),\nthe components of demand as well as the level of the real exchange rate (e). You\nare told as well that P,,,=1.25. Use this information to find the value of the\nnominal exchange rate (¢,,,, ).\n\nc) Suppose that the foreign economy becomes overheated with the result that the\nforeign price level increases from 1.25 to 14%, What would be the short and long-\nrun effects on the economy? Find as well the new value of the nominal exchange\nrate. What phenomena are being illustrated by this question?\n\nd) Go back to the situation where the foreign price level (P,,,) is once again at 1.25.\nNow suppose that the central bank, worried that the economy may be\noverheating, decides to decrease the nominal money supply from 100 to 99.5.\nCalculate, using the above model, what would be the short-run and then the\nlong-run equilibrium values for output (Y), the real exchange rate (e) and the\nnominal exchange rate (e,,,,). What is the process that drives the economy back\nto equilibrium?\n\n\n9 of 9\n\nB.5 The IS-LM model with fixed exchange rates (20 marks)\n\nThe following are the key equations for the economy.\n\nC4 =9.540.8(¥ -T)-300r\"\nI“ =20-200r\"\n\nNX“ =13-0.1¥ -1.25e\ncal 11.5+0.8¥ -300r”\nP\n\nee.\n\ne = Lnom\n\nP, For\n\na) Your first task is to write out the IS and LM curves with the world rate of interest\nrate on the left-hand side.\n\nb) Total taxes are 10 and the government is running a deficit of 5. The foreign price\nlevel (P.,.) is 1.25 while the nominal exchange rate (e,,,,) is 1.0. The real and\nnominal money supplies are equal to 100. If the world real rate of interest is\n2%%, what would be the level of output (Y) and net exports (NX). Is this\neconomy a user of foreign saving? Find as well consumption and investment and\nverify that the components of GDP add up to the value of Y that you found.\n\nFor what follows, you can consider the level of output you found in b) as equal\n\nto the economy's potential output.\n\nc) The government, wishing to boost its trade balance, considers two options:\n\na. A devaluation of the nominal exchange rate from 1 to 0.8; or\n\nb. Areduction of government spending of 0.25.\nIn order to help the government make an informed decision, calculate separately\nthe short- and long-run effects of each policy option.\n[Hint: Make your comparisons to the original values of Y and NX that you found\nin part b.]\n\nd) Based solely on the short-run effects on the economy and the trade balance,\nwhich policy would you recommend? Now considering only the long-run effects\non the economy and the trade balance, which policy would you recommend? Be\nsure to support your answers with sound economic analysis. In the end, which\npolicy would be the more successful?\n",

Find as well the level of C¢ and /¢ and verify that the\ncomponents of GDP add up to the level of Y you found.\n\nFor what follows, you can consider the level of output you found in b) as equal\n\nto the economy's potential output.\n\nc) Suppose that instead of balancing its budget, the government decides to run a\nbudget deficit equal to 5 by keeping its spending constant at G = 80 and\nlowering taxes. (Assume Ricardian Equivalence does not hold and all other\nvariables are held constant.) Calculate the short-run and long-run effects that\nthis would have on Y,r and P. Find the values of C¢ and /@ associated with new\nlong-run equilibrium.\n\nd) Assume that the government reverts to a balanced budget, G = T = 80. Suppose\nnow that 7° rises from 0 to 2%. Calculate the short-run effect that this would\nhave on Y,r and the nominal rate of interest. Calculate what would happen to\nthe price level, P, in the long run if no policy actions were taken.\n\ne} Suppose the government believes that it would take too much time for the price\nlevel to adjust. To return more quickly to long-run equilibrium after the\nincrease in inflation expectations described in part d), calculate by how much\ngovernment spending, G, would have to change, so that in the new long-run\nequilibrium, the price level remains unchanged at 1.\n",

The\nreal and the nominal money supply are the same at 100, while the real world\nrate of interest (r\") is 4%. Use this information to find the level of output (Y ),\nthe components of demand as well as the level of the real exchange rate (e). You\nare told as well that P,,,=1.25. Use this information to find the value of the\nnominal exchange rate (¢,,,, ).\n\nc) Suppose that the foreign economy becomes overheated with the result that the\nforeign price level increases from 1.25 to 14%, What would be the short and long-\nrun effects on the economy? Find as well the new value of the nominal exchange\nrate. What phenomena are being illustrated by this question?\n\nd) Go back to the situation where the foreign price level (P,,,) is once again at 1.25.\nNow suppose that the central bank, worried that the economy may be\noverheating, decides to decrease the nominal money supply from 100 to 99.5.\nCalculate, using the above model, what would be the short-run and then the\nlong-run equilibrium values for output (Y), the real exchange rate (e) and the\nnominal exchange rate (e,,,,).

Start by using the above equations to derive the aggregate demand (AD) curve for this\neconomy. Assume that the level of taxes (T) is 20 and that the government is running a fiscal\ndeficit of 5; the real money supply (M/P) is 45 and expected inflation (7°) is 0.02. Based on your\nAD curve, which of the following is the level of output (Y):\n\na) 105\n\nb) 110\n\nc) 100\n\nd) 95\n32. Now suppose that, in the short run, expected inflation increases from 0.02 to 0.03. What\nhappens to Y in the short run and why?\n\na) Y falls to 105.666... because the nominal interest rate has risen\n\nb) Y increases to 115.444... because nominal interest has fallen\n\nc) Y increases to 113.888... because the real interest rate has fallen\n\nd) Y remains unchanged at the level found in question | because the real interest rate has\n\nnot changed\n\n\nPage 6 of 8\n33. Assume that the results that you found in question 32 represent the economy’s short-run\nequilibrium and that the level of output you found in question 31 is the economy’s long-run\nequilibrium level of output. Assume also that the short-run price level was one (P = 1) and that\nthe central bank keeps the nominal money stock unchanged. Based on your AD curve, in the\nlong run, by how much does the price level change and why?\na) The price level rises to 1.084... because there was initially excess demand\nb) The price level remains unchanged because money is neutral in the long run\nc) The price level falls to 0.916 because the rise in expected inflation lowers demand\nd) The price level rises to 1.01 in line with the rise in expected inflation by 0.01\n34. Start again at the conditions that you found in question 31. Now assume that the government\nwants to balance its fiscal budget. In particular it lowers spending (G) to be in line with its level\nof taxation. Based on your model, what happens to the short-run level of output (Y) and the real\ninterest rate (r)?\na) Y increases to 115 as the real interest rate falls to 0.05206\nb) Y declines by 5 to 105, the amount by which G has fallen, and the real interest rate drops\nto 0.053\nc) Y declines to 104.44... and the real rate of interest drops to 0.05206...\nd) Y remains unchanged as the reduction on G crowds in consumption and investment and\nthe real rate of interest remains unchanged\n35. Assume that the answers to Y and r that you found in question 34 represent a short-run\nequilibrium and that, again, the level of output you found in question 31 is the economy’s long-\nrun equilibrium level of output. What happens to P and r in the long run and why?\na) The initial excess supply with M unchanged lowers the price level to 0.9. This shifts the\nLM curve to the right and lowers the real interest rate to 0.0457...\nb) The initial excess supply with M unchanged causes the price level to rise to 1.1 and this\ncauses the real money supply to fall raising interest rates to 0.0625\nc) Because money is neutral in the long run, the price level, real interest rates and real\noutput remain unchanged\nd) With the initial level of excess demand the price level rises to 1.125 and interest rates\nincrease to 0.074\nE: The ZS-LM model in an open economy\nBelow are the equations for a small open economy, where the definitions of the variables and the\nequations are familiar to you from the lectures, assignments and the textbook.

As well the foreign and domestic price level are both equal to one; P = Pror = 1.\nStart by deriving the IS curve for this economy with the real exchange rate (e) on the left-hand\nside. Next write the LM curve with output (Y) on the left-hand side. Writing these relationships\nwill help you to answer the following questions:\n36. You are given the following information: M/P = 60; G = 30; and T = 25. Find first the level\nof output and the real exchange rate for this economy. Which of the following are the correct\nvalues of each variable:\n\na) Y=125ande=0.9\n\nb) Y=130 ande=0.9\n\nc) Y=125 ande=0.8\n\nd) Y= 130 and e =0.8\n37. As noted above, the domestic and foreign price level are the same, implying that their ratio\n(P/PFor) is also one. Now suppose that the government wants to reduce its deficit. Economists in\nthe Department of Finance use the above model to estimate the effect on the economy of\nlowering government spending by | (i.e., G is now 29). Which among the following represents\nwhat happens to Y, e, enom and NX‘ in the short run:\n\na) Y=130,e=0.6, enom = 0.6 and NX¢= 1.5\n\nb) Y= 129, e = 0.6, enom = 0.6 and NX‘=~-1.0\n\nc) Y=130,e=0.6, enom = 0.6 and NX‘= 1.0\n\nd) Y=125,e=0.8, enom = 0.8 and NX¢= 1.5\n38. Going back to the model in question 36 above, now assume that the Economists in the\nDepartment of Finance want to see the effect of an increase in taxation by | (i.e., T is now 26).\nWhich among the following represents what happens to Y, e, enom and NX‘ in the short run:\n\na) Y=125, e=0.82, enom = 0.82 and NX‘ = 1.5\n\nb) Y= 130, e = 0.68, enom = 0.68 and NX‘ = 0.6\n\nc) Y=125,e=0.88, enom = 0.88 and NX‘ = 1.5\n\nd) Y=130, e =0.72, enom = 0.72 and NX‘ = 1.0\n39. Go back again to the model in question 36. Now assume that the government decides to peg\nthe exchange rate (i.e., they adopt a fixed exchange rate regime). The nominal exchange rate is\nset equal to 0.65 (enom = 0.65). Use the model to calculate the short-run effect on Y and NX‘.\nWhich among the following represents what happens to Y and NX° in the short run:\n\na) Y= 131.25 and NX¢=0.35\n\nb) Y = 131.00 and NX? = 0.25\n\nc) Y=132.00 and NX¢= 1.0\n\nd) Y=131.25 and NX¢= 1.0\n\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\n40. Now use your model to calculate the long-run effect of the devaluation of the nominal\nexchange rate. Which of the following represents what has happened to Y, e and the domestic\nprice level (P):\n\na) Y=130,e=0.65 and P=1.11\n\nb) Y= 132,e=0.7 and P= 1.26\n\nc) Y=131.25, e=0.8 and P = 1.23\n\nd) Y= 130, e=0.8 and P = 1.23\n",

Assume that the results that you found in question 32 represent the economy’s short-run\nequilibrium and that the level of output you found in question 31 is the economy’s long-run\nequilibrium level of output. Assume also that the short-run price level was one (P = 1) and that\nthe central bank keeps the nominal money stock unchanged. Based on your AD curve, in the\nlong run, by how much does the price level change and why?\na) The price level rises to 1.084... because there was initially excess demand\nb) The price level remains unchanged because money is neutral in the long run\nc) The price level falls to 0.916 because the rise in expected inflation lowers demand\nd) The price level rises to 1.01 in line with the rise in expected inflation by 0.01\n34.

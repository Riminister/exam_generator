Her\ntechnology can be described by the following production function: f(#1,22) = «1 + 4x2,\nwhere x1 denotes the amount of 1% milk and x2 denotes the amount of 2% milk. This\nproduction function means that the 1% milk and the 2% milk can be used interchangeably\nto produce butter according to a certain ratio.\n\n(a) Lynn wants to produce 1 unit of butter. If she uses only the 1% milk, how many units\nof 1% milk does she need? If she uses only the 2% milk, how many units of 2% milk\ndoes she need? (2 points)\n\n(b) Does the production function have increasing, decreasing, or constant marginal product\nof the 1% milk? Derive the marginal product MP, of the 1% milk and the marginal\nproduct MP, of the 2% milk. Calculate the technical rate of substitution TRS. (4\npoints)\n\n(c) If the price of 1% milk is $3 and the price of 2% milk is $5, to product 2 units of butter,\nhow much of the two inputs should Lynn use to minimize her cost? Draw a graph of\nthe isoquant and isocost line to show this optimal bundle of inputs. Carefully label the\nintercepts and slopes.

The Neoclassical growth model (20 marks)\nConsider an economy with the following aggregate production function:\n\nY, = AK&EP Ni?\n\nwhere Y, is aggregate output, A represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock, N; is\nthe number of workers in the economy, and E is the quantity of energy. Total factor productivity, A, and\nenergy, E, are fixed (constant). The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at rate d, and the\nhouseholds save a constant fraction s of their income.\n\na) Lety, = “, k= = , and e, = 7 Derive the intensive form of the production function in per\n\nC t\nworker terms. Show your steps.\n\nb) Suppose the steady state investment for this economy is: ] = (n + d)K. Find an expression for\nthe capital-labour ratio in the steady state.\n\nc) Derive an algebraic expression for the Golden Rule level of capital per worker, kg. For what\nsaving rate (s) will the steady-state level of capital per worker equal the Golden Rule level of\ncapital per worker?\n\nd) Now assume there is a massive storm and 25% of the energy grid becomes unusable. In other\nwords, this 25% is no longer available for production. Find the new steady-state capital-labour\nratio. Show on a graph and explain the transition between the old and the new equilibrium.\n\n\nPage 8 of 10\nB.2 Equilibrium in Labour Market (20 marks)\nSuppose we have an economy with the following aggregate production function: Y = K*(AN)* + EY\nY stands for output, K for the capital stock, N for the number of people employed in production, F for the\nquantity of energy used in production, and A for a measure of labour efficiency. The coefficients a, 8 and\ny are parameters whose values are between 0 and 1. Suppose a = 8 = y = 0.5.\n\na) Based on the production function, derive an algebraic expression for the demand for labour,\nassuming that w is the real wage. Be sure to sub in the values for a and f as this will simplify your\nfinal relationship.\n\nb) Now suppose that the supply curve is upward-sloping and has the following form:\n\nNi =w\ni. Find an algebraic equation for the equilibrium real wage, #, and equilibrium employment, NV.\nii. Now suppose, A = 4; K = 16; and E= 1.

Find the new values for the\nequilibrium real wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output,\nY. Use 2 decimals if needed. Also, show this shock using 2 graphs: one for the labour market and\nanother for the production function.\n\nd) Instead of the supply shock of part c), let’s suppose the country invest heavily in energy\ninfrastructure and the quantity of energy quadruple, E = 4. Find the new values for the equilibrium\nreal wage, W, equilibrium employment, N, and the level of full employment output, Y.

As well, note that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on\ndesired consumption and investment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your\ncalculations.\n\na) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the AD\ncurve with Y on the left-hand side. Be sure to include inflation expectations (7°).\n\nb) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 41; the price level is 1; the\nlevel of taxation is 30; the budget is balanced; and expected inflation is 2%, which in turn is the central\nbank’s inflation target. Based on this, find the level of full-employment output and then the real rate\nof interest.\n\nc) Recently, Canada along with other economies has been experiencing inflation problems. Using the\nmodel here, suppose that 7° rises to 4%, due to news about impending temporary supply disruptions.\nNote the FE curve is not affected. Assuming that the central bank keeps the nominal money supply\nunchanged, calculate what happens to output and the real interest rate in the short run. [Hint: Use the\nZS curve to find the new real rate of interest.]\n\nd) In the face of the increase in expected inflation, the Bank of Canada decides to keep the money supply\nunchanged and let the economy adjust back to equilibrium. Rewrite your AD curve with the price level\non the left-hand side and then calculate what happens to the price level as the economy moves back to\nthe equilibrium level of output that you found in b). Briefly describe the mechanism driving the\neconomy back to equilibrium. As well, suppose that it takes three years for the economy to adjust back\nto equilibrium. What is the annual inflation rate? Is the rate above the Bank’s target 2% target?\n\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\nB4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe economy in question is small and takes the world rate of interest (r”) as given. It can be described\n\nby the following equations:\n\nC4 =18 + 0.6(Y —T) — 100r” Desired consumption\n\n14 = 19-100r” Desired investment\n\nNX4 = 10—0.1Y — 3e Desire net exports\n\nY=C4+1974+G+4NX4 Equilibrium\n\nM?4/P =7.5 + 0.5Y —200r” Real money demand\n\n€ = CnomP/Pror Real exchange rate\n\nAs above, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and\n\ninvestment is equal to that of money demand, a feature that will simplify your calculations.\n\na) Your first task is to derive expressions for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand sides of your\nequations. Now use those two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with Y on the\nleft-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side. You will be working with these two equations\nplus those for net export and real exchange rate above.\n\nb) You are given the following information: government spending (G) is 30; the government has a deficit\nof 5; the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5; and the real money supply (M#/P) is 45. Find first the level of\noutput, which you are to assume is the economy’s long-run equilibrium level, as well as the world real\nrate of interest (r”). Next assume that the nominal money supply (M4) is 54, use your price level\nequation to calculate the price level. If the foreign price level (Pro) is 1, what is the level of the\nnominal exchange rate (€n9.,)? Find as well, the level of net exports.\n\nc) Assume that this economy has adopted a fixed exchange rate system and that the nominal exchange\nrate, €nom, is pegged at the level you found in b). Use your model to find the short-run effect on output\nof a rise in government spending from 30 to 32. Note that the government deficit also rises as taxes\nremain constant at the level found in b). Use your model to calculate what has happened to the money\nsupply in the short run and explain why. In the long, the economy must return to equilibrium. Describe\nwhat has to happen to net exports in equilibrium given the increase in government spending. Based on\nthis, use the net export equation to find the new level of the real exchange rate and the new level of\nthe domestic price level.\n\nd) Now assume that this economy has adopted a flexible exchange rate system; that is, the nominal\nexchange rate, @nom, will now do the adjusting. Based on the class discussion, use the TS-I.M-FE\ndiagrams to describe what would happen in the short and long run when the government raises\nspending from 30 to 32. As well, calculate what would happen to the nominal exchange rate to restore\nequilibrium.",

Long Run Economic Growth in the Solow model (20 marks)\nConsider an economy with the following aggregate production function:\n¥, = AKEN}-*\nwhere Y, is aggregate output, A, represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock,\nand N; is the number of workers in the economy. The labour force grows at rate n, capital depreciates at\nrate d, and the households save a constant fraction, s, of their income.\na) Let y, = Ad and k, = = . Derive the intensive form of the production function in per worker terms.\nt t\nShow your steps.\nb) Derive an algebraic expression for the level of investment per worker and saving per worker in a\nsteady-state equilibrium. Also, find the expression for the capital-labour ratio in the steady state. With\nthe aid of the diagram, show that this equilibrium point is stable. Briefly explain your reasoning.\nc) Now, suppose there are two economies (A and B) that are described by the intensive form of the\nproduction function found in part a). The two economies are identical in all respects except that A has a\nhigher savings rate than B: s, > Sg. Explain using a diagram what this implies for the relative steady-\nstate levels of capital and output per worker in each country.\nd) Suppose that, in addition to having a higher savings rate, economy A also has a higher population\ngrowth rate than economy B: s, > Sg and ny > ng. Is it possible that both economies have the same\nsteady-state output per worker? Explain with the aid of a diagram.\nB2. Asset market equilibrium (20 marks)\nSuppose that the real money demand function is given by\nma\n>= L(Y,r+x°) = 7004+0.1Y — 5000 (r+ 7°)\nwhere M?@ is the nominal money balances demanded, P is the price level, Y is total output, r is the real\ninterest rate, and 7° is the expected inflation rate.\n\n\nPage 7 of 9\na) Assuming that the asset market is currently in equilibrium at r = 0.05. Calculate the nominal money\nsupply, MS, if Y = 2000, P = 2 and 1° = 0.05. What is the velocity of money in this economy? What\nis the value of k in the quantity theory of money?\nb) Assume that the quantity theory of money holds and that velocity is constant at the level you found in\npart a). In this same economy, the central bank fixes the nominal money supply (M*) at 500. With\noutput fixed at its full-employment level (Y = 2000) and assuming that prices are flexible, what will be\nthe new price level? What happens to the price level if the nominal money supply rises to 600?\nc) Now, suppose the central bank follows a money supply rule. In particular, it sets the money supply\naccording to:\nMS = 1000 + 0.1Y — 4000z.\nIf expected inflation equals actual inflation 7 = 1° = 0.03, Y = 1000, and r = 0,02, calculate the price\nlevel in equilibrium using the real money demand function in part a).\nd) Now, suppose that the new real money demand function is given by:\nmé y?\nPP (r+?)\n\nWhat are the elasticities of real money demand with respect to real income and the nominal interest rate,\nrespectively?

Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side.\nb) Assume the expected inflation rate, 1°, is 5%, the real money supply, M /P, is 500, the price level, P,\nis 1, government spending, G, is 200, and the government has a budget deficit of 100. Using your results\nfrom part a), find the full employment level of output, Y, and the real interest rate, r.\nc) Now assume there is a temporary negative productivity shock and the new full employment level of\noutput, ¥>, is now 1300. Find the price level, P, as well as the real interest rate, r, in the long run. Show\ngraphically and explain the transition between the old and the new long-run equilibria.\nd) One of the goals of the Bank of Canada is to keep inflation low and stable. Calculate the new level of\nnominal money supply, M, required to avoid the change in the price level, P, found in part c). In other\nwords, the Bank of Canada wants to keep the price level at 1 in the long run.\nB4. The open economy IS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\nA small open economy is described by the following equations:\n\nC4 = 900 + 0.5(Y — T) — 1000r\n\n1? = 600 — 1000r\n\nNX = 900 — 0.25Y — 400e\n\nM4\n\n>= 0.5Y — 2000(r + 2°)\nwhere Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate, e, is the real exchange rate, 7°, is\ninflation expectations, T is a lump-sum tax, C 4 is desired consumption, /* is desired investment, NX is\nnet export, and M is the nominal supply of money which is set by the central bank.\n\n\nPage 9 of 9\n\na) Derive an algebraic expression for the IS and LM curves with the real interest rate, r, on the left-hand\nside of the equation. Find also the AD curve, with real output, Y, on the left-hand side.\nb) Assume the expected inflation rate, 7°, is 5%, the real money supply, M/P, is 1000, the domestic and\nforeign price level, P and Py,,, are 1, the nominal exchange rate, €nom, is 2, government spending, G, is\n450, and the government budget is balanced. Using your results from part a), find the full employment\nlevel of output, Y, and the world interest rate, r”.\nc) Assume this economy has a flexible exchange rate regime. The central bank has decided to increase\nthe nominal money supply to 1080. Find real output, Ysp, and the real exchange rate, esp, in the\nKeynesian short-run equilibrium. Also, show graphically and explain the initial equilibrium, the short-\nrun equilibrium, and the return to the long-run equilibrium.\nd) “Consumer sentiment (confidence) falls.” Using the open economy IS-LM-FE framework, show\ngraphically and explain how the change in consumer expectations, highlighted in this headline, would\nimpact the economy if the economy had:\n\ni. A flexible exchange rate regime.\n\nii. A fixed exchange rate regime.\nMake sure to show the initial equilibrium (assume the economy is initially in general equilibrium), the\nshort-run equilibrium, and the return to the long-run equilibrium. /Note: No calculations needed].",

The Neoclassical growth model (20 marks)\n\nConsider an economy with the following aggregate production function:\n\n¥, = AKZLP Ne =ea0) Production function\n\nwhere Y; is aggregate output, A represents total factor productivity, K; is the aggregate capital stock,\n\nN, is the number of workers in the economy, and L is the quantity of available land. Total factor\n\nproductivity, A, and tand, L, are fixed (constant). The labour force grows at rate n, capital\n\ndepreciates at rate d, and the households save a constant fraction s of their income.\n\na) Lety, = st, k= pa , and 1, = os Derive the intensive form of the production function in per\n\nt t t\nworker terms. Show your steps.\n\nb) The steady state level of investment for this economy is: = (n + d)K. Find an expression for\nthe capital-labour ratio in the steady state, k**.\n\nc) Derive an algebraic expression for the Golden Rule level of capital per worker, kg. Show\ngraphically this special steady state.\n\nd) Now assume there is an environmental disaster and 10% of the land becomes unusable for\nproduction. Find an equation for the new steady-state capital-labour ratio. Show on a graph\nand explain the transition between the old and the new equilibrium.\n\nB.2 Asset Market (20 marks)\n\nAssume the real money demand function is:\n\nL(Y, i) = 1000 + 0.5Y — 5000(r + 2°) Real money demand\n\nwhere Y is real output, P is the price level, r is the real interest rate on non-monetary assets, 1° is\n\nexpected inflation.\n\na) Assuming that the asset market is in equilibrium at i = 0.05.

(Note: please round your answers to the nearest three decimal places for all parts of this\nquestion.)\n\nb) Find the real income elasticity of money demand at the equilibrium level of money balances\nfound in part a). Explain what it means.\n\n\n8 of 10\n¢) The rate of inflation in this economy is defined as the growth rate of the nominal money supply\nminus an adjustment for the growth rate of real money demand arising from growth in the real\noutput:\nAM AY :\n\nTa Nyy Inflation\nSuppose the central bank has a target inflation rate of 2%, real output growth is 8%, and the\nincome elasticity of real money demand equals the value found in part b). What actions could\nthe central bank take to attain this objective?\n\nd) Does the quantity theory of money hold in this economy; that is does MV= PY? State your\nreason by considering the new levels of nominal money supply, real output, and price using\nthe growth rates from part ¢).\n\nB.3 Closed economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of a closed economy\n\nC4 = 144 0.75(Y —T) - 80r Desired consumption\n\nI* =18-60r Desired investment\n\nY=C4+17+G Equilibrium in the goods market\n\nM/P=7+0.5(Y —T) —140(r) Real money supply is equal to demand\n\nIn the above, Y is real output, 7 is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real interest rate\n\nand P is the price level. Note that 2° = 0, so that the nominal rate of interest is equal to the real\n\nrate and that the central bank controls the nominal money supply (14). As well, note that the sum\nof the interest rate coefficients on desired consumption and investment is equal to that of money\ndemand, a feature that will simplify your calculations of the aggregate demand curve.\n\na) Derive both the JS and LM curves for this economy, with r on the left-hand side as well as the\nAD curve, also with Y on the left-hand side. Note that, different for the classroom version, the\ndemand for money is related to affer-tax income. Looking at the JS and LM curves, discuss (no\ncalculations required) what would happen to each curve if the level of taxation were to fall?\nBriefly explain why.\n\nb) You are given the following information: the nominal money supply is 40; the price level is 1,\nthe level of taxation is 20; and the government has a budgetary surplus of 5. Based on this, find\nthe level of full-employment output (Y) and then the real rate of interest (7).\n\n\n9 of 10\n\nc) With an election pending, the government is coming under pressure to do something about its\nsurplus. One group wants the level of taxation to be reduced to the level of government\nspending, while the other wants government spending to be raised to match current levels of\ntaxation. Based on your aggregate demand curve, calculate the short-run effect of each policy\non GDP and the real rate of interest. What happens to interest rates in each case and why? You\nare to assume that the nominal money supply stays constant at 40.\n\nd) As prime minister, you have to make a decision. Using your answers from part ¢, suppose that\na significant proportion of the population is young and they are worried about overall demand\nconditions, in other works, employment prospects. On the other hand, there is an older group\nthat wants less government spending, with minimal effects on interest rates. Both groups are\nhappy to have a balanced budget in place. Based on your model, which alternative appeals to\neach group.\n\nB.4 The open economy JS-LM-FE model (20 marks)\n\nThe following represents the key equations of an open economy:\n\nc4 =2+0.80Y — 80r” Desired consumption\n\n14 = 13-60r” Desired investment\n\nNX4 =12-0.1Y —2e Desired net exports\n\nY=C4+1*+G6+4NX4 Equilibrium in the goods market\n\nM/P=12+0.5Y —140r” Real money supply is equal to demand\n\n€ = €nomP /Pror Real exchange rate\n\nAs in Question B.3, you will notice that the sum of the interest rate coefficients on desired\n\nconsumption and investment is equal to that on money demand, a feature that will simplify your\n\ncalculations. For simplicity, taxation is zero — one less thing to worry about.\n\na) Use the above model to find equations for the JS and LM curves, with ron the left-hand side\nin each case. Now use these two relationships to derive the aggregate demand curve, first with\nY on the left-hand side and then with P on the left-hand side.\n\nb) You are given the following values for key variables: government spending (G) is 10; the real\nmoney supply (//P) is 50; and the real exchange rate (e) is 1.5. Find the level of output, the\nworld real rate of interest (r”) and the trade balance (NX). Assuming that the level of output\nyou found is the economy’s equilibrium level and given that M = 50, find the equilibrium\nprice level. Finally suppose that the price level in the foreign country (Pror) is 0.6; what is the\nlevel of the nominal exchange rate (€nom)?\n\n\n10 of 10\n\nc) Assume that the exchange rate is flexible and that the central bank, worried about the high level\nof prices compared with the foreign country, decides to lower the level of the money supply\n(M) from 50 to 48. Find the short-run effect on the level of output (Y), the real and nominal\nexchange rate (e and énom) and net exports (NX) and then the long-run effect of this policy on\nthese variables.\n\n[Hint: To find the short-run effect on output, use the LM curve and then proceed to the JS curve\nto find the short-run level of the real exchange rate, e. To find the long-run effect on the\ndomestic price level use the definition of the real exchange rate.]\n\nd) Suppose that the government decides to fix the exchange rate at the nominal value that you\nfound in part b). Note that this assumption implies that the initial real exchange rate is as above,\n1.5. The government still wishes to have a lower price level for competitive reasons but, with\nfixed exchange rates, they cannot use monetary policy. Based on advice from this class, they\ndecide instead to cut government spending from 10 to 9. Use the IS curve that you found in\npart b) to find the short-run level of output, remembering that e is unchanged. From class, you\nknow that the economy will return to its long-run equilibrium level of output but with a lower\nlevel of G and with implications for net exports. Use the net export equation to find the new\nlevel of the real exchange rate. Note you will need to find the new level of the trade balance.\nFinally, based on the definition of the real exchange rate, find the new price level.\n\nComparing the two systems (fixed and flexible exchange rates), which saw the largest fall in\nthe price level?",

Each question is worth 20 marks.\nC1. Consider the following version of the neoclassical (Solow) growth model. Suppose\nthe relationship between output and productive inputs at any point in time is represented\nby\n\nY=A Ke. NOS\n\nSuppose also that population growth is n, the savings rate is s, and the rate of depreciation\nof capital is d.\na. Express the production in per worker terms by letting y = x and k= x.\nb. Derive the dynamics of capital per worker. Derive an expression for the\nsteady-state capital stock per worker, k*, and an expression for the steady-state\noutput per worker, y*. Illustrate the steady-state for this economy on a diagram.\nc. Now suppose there are two countries (A and B), that are identical in all\nrespects except that country A has a higher savings rate than B: s4 > sg. Ex-\nplain using a diagram what this implies for the relative steady-state levels of\ncapital per worker in each country.\nOne shortcoming of the neoclassical growth model is that the model assumes rather than\nexplains the productivity growth and hence the growth rate of output. In response to this\nshortcoming, endogenous growth theory has been developed to explain productivity growth.\nNow suppose we augment the neoclassical model with human capital and output is given by\nY = AK®*(RN)°5. Suppose also that population growth is n, the savings rate is s, and the\nrate of depreciation of capital is d.\nd. Express the production in per worker terms. Derive the dynamics of capital\nper worker and an expression for the steady-state capital stock per worker, k*,\nas a function of human capital per worker h.\ne. Consider now the two countrie (A and B) have the same production function\naugumented with human capital and equal values of A, s, n and d. Besides in\nboth countries physical capital per worker is proportional to human capital per\nworker, k = Bh. If country A has twice the human capital h, of country B ha,\nwhat does this imply for their relative per worker outputs in steady-state?\n\n\n10 of 13\nC2.

This citizen is in-\nterested in investing in either the government, bond from the United States of America or\nthe government bond from France. Both investments last two years. Before making the\ninvestment, the Canadian investor collected the information for several countries:\nCountry Amount of currency Annual interest rate\nU.S.A 110 3%\nFrance 100 2%\nJapan 12,000 5%\nCanada 147 4% ‘\na. Given that the investor is interested in only two bonds and given its following\nexpected nominal exchange rates:\nCountry Expected nominal exchange rate in two years\nU.S.A 0.719\nFrance 0.625\nJapan 93.75\nCanada 1.00\nCalculate the expected gross nominal rate of return for both bonds.

(26 points): The five parts have roughly the same number of points.\n\nConsider the following augmented version of the Solow (neoclassical) growth model. Sup-\npose that the relationship between output per worker, y, physical capital per worker, k, and\nhuman capital per worker, h, at any point in time is represented by y = Af(k,h). The\nfunction f is increasing in k and h, and has diminishing marginal product of k. Suppose\nthat A and h are exogenous constants, population growth is n > 0, the savings rate is s, and\nthe rate of depreciation of capital is d > 0.\n\n(1) Explain intuitively why the dynamic evolution of k is described by the equation\n\nAk = sAf(k,h) —(n+4)k.\n\n(2) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*,\nis determined. If the initial value of k is ko < k*, illustrate and explain the process by which\nthe economy converges to the steady state.\n\n(3) IWustrate on a diagram the impact of an increase in the stock of human capital per\nworker, h, on the steady-state level of output per worker. Describe how the economy adjusts\nfrom its original steady state to the new steady state.\n\n(4) Consider two countries that have the same production function\n\ny= Akh?\nand equal values of A = 1, s = 0.2, n = 0.02 and d = 0.08. If country 2 has twice the human\ncapital per worker of country 1, analyze what this implies for the two countries’ relative per\nworker outputs in steady state.\n\n(5) Explain the idea of conditional convergence that is predicted by the Solow model.\nExplain why this prediction need not be inconsistent with the overall pattern of divergence\nin the distribution of relative per capita income observed in the real world.\n\nProblem 3. (26 points): Closed economy IS-LM-FE.\n\nThe following four equations describe a closed economy:\nC4+=19+0.5(Y —T) —100r Desired consumption\nI¢=27-50r Desired investment\nY=Ct?+I4+G Goods market equilibrium\nM=94+06Y —150r Money market equilibrium\n\n~e\n\n\nIn the above, Y is real output, T is total taxes, G is government spending, r is the real\nrate of interest, and P is the aggregate price level. Note that in the final equation, M is\nthe money supply (which is under the control of the central bank) and it is set equal to the\ndemand for money. You should also note that the interest-rate coefficients on consumption\nand investment sum to 150, which is equal to the interest-rate coefficient on the money\ndemand equation. This will make deriving the AD curve somewhat less burdensome.\n\n(1) Find the IS and LM curves for the economy, in each case with the real interest rate\non the left-hand side. Derive as well an equation for the aggregate demand, AD, curve, with\nY on the left-hand side.\n\n(2) Suppose that G = 20, M/P = 60 and that the government is running a budgetary\nsurplus of 5. Given this information, find the level of real output, Y , using the AD curve\nfor this economy. Given the level of real output (Y) that you found, use the equation for\nyour LM curve to solve for the real rate of interest, r. You are to assume that the values\nof Y and r that you found are the long-run equilibrium values for this economy. As well,\nassume that the price level is 1, implying that the nominal money supply is 60.\n\n(3) Because of innovations in the financial system, the public is able to economize on its\nholdings for money balances. In your model, this is reflected as a shift down in the demand\nfor real money balances and is captured by having the constant term in the money demand\nequation decline from 9 to 7. Initially the central bank holds the money supply constant\nat 60. Use again your AD curve to find the new level of output. [Hint: In this short-run\nequilibrium, hold the price level, P, constant.]\n\n(4) Using the diagrams familiar to you from class and the course, describe what is hap-\npening. Be sure to compare the new level of output you found with that you found in part\n(2). Based on this comparison, what are the implications for the price level.\n\n(5) Now rewrite your AD curve, with the price level, P, on the left-hand side. Suppose\nthat the economy is now back in equilibrium, with Y = Y , where Y is equal to the level you\nfound in part (2). What has happened to the price level? What process is being illustrated?\n\n(6) Suppose now that the central bank is worried about the inflationary implications of\nthe shift in the money demand equation. What would be the implications for the money\nsupply supposing that the central bank wanted to keep the price level unchanged at the level\nin part (2)?\n\n\n\nProblem 4. (26 points): Open economy IS-LM-FE.\n\nKeeping the equations for C4, J¢, and u the same as in Problem 3 above, suppose that\nthis economy becomes open to trade. To capture this development, an equation for net\nexports, NX*%, has been added. The final equation is the definition of the real exchange\nrate, e. Note that the country is small and takes the world real rate of interest, r” , as given.\n\nC4=19+0.5(Y —T) —100r” Desired consumption\nI¢=27-50r” Desired investment\nY=Ct+I4+G+NxX? Goods market equilibrium\nNX?¢ =21.5-—0.1Y —4e Desired net exports\n\nuy =9+0.6Y — 150r” Money market equilibrium\ne= Sem Real exchange rate\n\n(1) Use the above equations to write out the IS and LM curves for this economy, with\nr” on the left-hand side.\n\n(2) Suppose that the world interest rate is 4% and that the real money supply is 66. Find\nthe level of real output, Y.\n\n(3) The economy is specialized in certain goods and services and, as a result, it has a\nsurplus of 5; that is, NX¢ = 5. Find the level of the real exchange rate, e. If the price level\n(P) in this economy were equal to the foreign price level (Py,,), what would be the level of\nthe nominal exchange rate, €nom?\n\n(4) Assume that the nominal exchange rate is fixed at the level you found in part (3).\nAs well assume that G = 20 and T = 25. Now suppose that the economy is hit with a 25%\ntariff, which in effect will raise the domestic price level, P, by that amount. What is the\nnew level of the real exchange rate?\n\n(5) Now find the new, short-run level of output, assuming that the nominal exchange\nrate is unchanged. To do this, you will have to use your IS curve, but now with output, Y,\non the right-hand side. In percentage terms, by how much has output changed?\n\n(6) Use the diagrams for the IS, LM and FE model to describe what would happen in\nthe long run to output, the domestic price level and the nominal and real exchange rate\nassuming in turn that the economy has fixed and then flexible exchange rates.

Suppose that at any point in time the production function in\nper-worker terms is represented by :\n\ny = Ak?,\nwhere f(k) is increasing in k and there are diminishing returns to capital. Suppose that A is\nconstant, labour N grows at rate n, the saving rate is s, and the rate of capital depreciation\nis d.\n(a) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, is\ndetermined.\n(b) Solve for the steady-state level of capital per worker k*, output per worker, y*, and\nconsumption per worker, c*, assuming that total factor productivity, A, is 1, the saving rate,\n8, is 0.4, the population growth, n, is 0.02, and the depreciation rate, d, is 0.08.\n(c) Suppose that there is a war that destroys half the capital stock, K, but leaves the labour\nforce unchanged. Calculate the immediate impact of the war on capital per worker, output\nper worker, and consumption per worker.\n(d) Show graphically how the economy returns to the steady-state following the destruction\nof half the capital stock.\n(e) Suppose instead that the war destroys half the labour force (NV) but leaves the capital\nstock unchanged. Assume that the economy was in the steady-state derived in part (b) before\nthe war and the rate of population growth, n, returns to normal after the war. Calculate the\nimmediate impact of the war on capital per worker, output per worker, and consumption\nper worker.\n\n\nPage 9 of 11\nB2.

How does the position of the LM curve depend\non P?\n(c) If government purchases are G = 196, derive an expression for the aggregate demand\ncurve. If the full-employment output level is Y = 1000, what is the price level and the real\ninterest rate in general equilibrium?\n(d) Starting from the situation in part (c), suppose government purchases are increased to\nG = 216, what are the resulting values of Y, r, P, T, C* and I? in the short-run?\n(e) How does the economy adjust to its new general equilibrium after the change in part\n(d)?

Assume M = 480.\nWhat are the general equilibrium values of r and P? Illustrate this general equilibrium using\nthe IS-LM-FE diagram.\n(c) Suppose that this economy has a flexible nominal exchange rate and that the government\ndecides to impose an import quota in order to restrict imports. What would be the short-run\neffect of this policy on Y, NX, and e holding the price level P constant (no calculations\n‘ necessary)? Illustrate the effects using the IS-LM-FE diagram.\n(d) Suppose instead that this economy has a fixed exchange rate. What would be the short-\nrun effect of this policy on Y, NX, and e holding the price level P constant (no calculations\nnecessary)? Illustrate the effects using the IS-LM-FE diagram.\n(e) Explain the process that restores the economy to general equilibrium under fixed ex-\nchange rates.

Suppose that at any point in time the production function in\nper-worker terms is represented by\ny = Af(k),\nwhere f(k) is increasing in & and there are diminishing returns to capital. Suppose that A is\nconstant, labour N grows at rate n, the saving rate is s, and the rate of capital depreciation\nis d.\n(a) With the aid of a diagram, explain how the steady state capital stock per worker, k*, is\ndetermined.\n(b) Suppose that there is a shock to households’ preferences that increases the saving rate\nto sg, the saving rate consistent with moving the economy to the Golden Rule steady state.\nShow graphically how the economy reaches the new steady state. Explain what happens to\nsteady-state consumption per-worker, c*, and to the steady state capital stock per worker,\nk*, after the rise in s.\n(c) At what rate do output per worker, y, and output, Y, grow at the new steady state?\nWhat about during the period of adjustment from the original steady steady to the new\none?\n(d) Suppose that before the shock to households’ preferences, the saving rate was above sg.\nWhat happens in this case to steady-state consumption per-worker, c*, and the steady state\ncapital stock per worker, k*, after the rise in s.\n(e) According to the Solow (neoclassical) growth model, what is the dominant factor deter-\nmining the long-run growth of output per capita? Explain why.\n\n\nPage 8 of 10\nB2.

Assume that the economy is initially in\na general equilibrium with government expenditure G set to 20, the nominal money supply\nM set to 195 and the price level P equal to 1.\n(a) What are the gencral equilibrium levels of the real wage, employment, and output?\n(b) Derive the IS and LM equations writing the real interest rate on the left side of the\nequations. Find the implied long-run real interest rate and output.\n(c) Suppose the government increases its expenditure to G = 40. What are the short-run\noutput and real interest rate?

In each case, illustrate\nthe effects on a diagram starting from an initial situation of general equilibrium.\n(a) A reduction in the effective tax rate on capital that increases desired investment.\n(b) A rise in the expected rate of inflation.\n(c) An influx of working-age immigrants which increases the labour supply.\n(d) An increase in the volatility of the stock market.\n(e) A decrease in the world real interest rate.\n\n\n\nPage 10 of 10\nB4. Keynesian model with nominal wage rigidity: Consider a simple economy in\nwhich all workers are identical and only one type of good is produced. The production\nfunction is 1\nY =4N2,\nwhere Y is output and N is the number of workers (in millions). The supply curve for labour\nis given by\nWw\nN* =05 >\nP\nwhere W is the nominal wage and P is the aggregate price level (so W/P is the real wage).\n(a) Derive the labour demand curve.\n(b) If the labour market is in equilibrium, find the implied real wage, the level of ermployment,\nand full-employment output, Y.\n(c) Suppose W is determined before P is known for sure at a value such that the labour\nmarket is expected to clear. If the expected price level is P* = 2, at what value is W set?\nFor any realized price level, P, what is employment and what is the short-run aggregate\nsupply (SRAS) curve for this economy?\nThe IS and LM curves for this economy are described by\n4000r = 800— 100Y (IS)\nM\n2000r = 50Y — 6S (LM)\nwhere Y denotes income/output, r denotes the real interest rate and M = 100 is the money\nsupply.\n(d) Derive the equation for the aggregate demand (AD) curve.\n(e) What are the short-run equilibrium values of P, Y and r?

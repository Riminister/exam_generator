# 🚀 Quick Start: Link Your OpenAI Account

## Step 1: Run the Setup Script

```bash
python setup_openai.py
```

This will:
1. Ask for your OpenAI API key
2. Save it securely to `.env` (not committed to git)
3. Test the connection

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

If you don't have one yet:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy it (you'll only see it once!)

## Step 3: Test It

```bash
python openai_question_generator.py
```

This will generate a sample question to verify everything works.
